<p class="ph2">PREFACE TO THE SERIES</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> series consists of five volumes, four of which are intended
as textbooks for pupils in manual-training, industrial, trade, technical,
or normal schools. The fifth book of the series, the “Handbook
in Woodwork and Carpentry,” is for the use of teachers and
of normal students who expect to teach the subjects treated in the
other four volumes.</p>

<p>Of the pupils’ volumes, the first two, “Elements of Woodwork”
and “Elements of Construction,” are adapted to the needs of students
in manual-training schools, or in any institution in which
elementary woodwork is taught, whether as purely educational
handwork, or as preparatory to a high, or trade, school course in
carpentry or vocational training.</p>

<p>The volumes “Constructive Carpentry” and “Inside Finishing”
are planned with special reference to the students of technical,
industrial, or trade schools, who have passed through the
work of the first two volumes, or their equivalent. The subjects
treated are those which will be of greatest value to both the prospective
and the finished workman.</p>

<p>For the many teachers who are obliged to follow a required
course, but who are allowed to introduce supplementary or
optional models under certain conditions, and for others who
have more liberty and are able to make such changes as they
see fit, this series will be found perfectly adaptable, regardless
of the grades taught. To accomplish this, the material has been
arranged by topics, which may be used by the teacher irrespective
of the sequence, as each topic has to the greatest extent possible
been treated independently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span></p>

<p>The author is indebted to Dr. George A. Hubbell, Ph.D., now
President of the Lincoln Memorial University, for encouragement
and advice in preparing for and planning the series, and to
George R. Swain, Principal of the Eastern High School of Bay
City, Michigan, for valuable aid in revising the manuscript.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is due various educational and trade periodicals,
and the publications of the United States Departments of
Education and of Forestry, for the helpful suggestions that the
author has gleaned from their pages.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph2">PREFACE TO ELEMENTS OF WOODWORK</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> preparing this book, it has been the author’s purpose to
present, in as complete and concise form as possible, the knowledge
which every wood-worker should possess regarding the care
and use of his tools and the material upon which he employs
them.</p>

<p>Whether an amateur, apprentice, or skilled workman, whether
a carpenter, boat builder, pattern maker, or wood carver, the elementary
knowledge of the construction of tools, of sharpening
them, and of their adjustment and manipulation is practically the
same. The structure of wood, and the necessity of applying its
peculiarities of grain and texture to the advantage of the work in
hand, also is the same upon all branches of woodwork.</p>

<p>While innumerable tools and cutting devices have been invented
to enable the wood-worker to accomplish special results economically
both as to time and material, a study of them will prove
that they all operate upon a few simple principles, a knowledge
of which is not difficult to acquire, though skill and judgment in
the application of the tools can be attained only by continuous
and properly directed practice.</p>

<p>It would be both impossible and unnecessary in a book of this
sort to describe these various devices, though in a schoolroom it
is a great advantage to have as many of them as practicable, not
for their use only, but that the students may become familiar
with their purposes and the applications of the fundamental principles
upon which each is based.</p>

<p>The actual use of tools may be considered the A B C of woodwork,
as it bears the same relation to the finished product of the
workman as the alphabet bears to literature, the space between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
the mere mechanical facility in the use of either tools or alphabet,
being the result of the judgment, skill, and individuality of
either the workman or the author.</p>

<p>Thus, if a student acquires the facility to use the tools described
in this volume, he will have little difficulty in using other and
more complex tools; and when he has mastered the principles
of construction involved in the exercises explained in the following
book of this series, the “Elements of Construction,” and the
correct use of the tools involved in making these, together with
their applications and combinations, he has acquired the fundamental
knowledge of all construction in wood.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="c large"><span class="smcap">Growth of Wood</span></p>


<p><b>1. Kinds of trees used for lumber.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) The classification
of trees here considered is based upon the method by
which the trunk, or stem, of a tree is formed. The term
<i>exogenous</i> is applied to outside growers, around which a
layer of wood grows each year, and from which is cut the
lumber of commerce. As the wood-worker is interested
mainly in trees which grow by this method, we will do no
more than mention the <i>endogenous</i>, or inside-growing, trees
or plants of the nature of palm trees, cornstalks, etc., in
which the woody fiber is formed upon the inside of the
stem.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The new wood formed each year upon exogenous
trees is known as the <i>annual layer</i>, or <i>ring</i>; the separate
layers being more prominent in open-grained woods, such
as oak, ash, and chestnut, than in close-grained woods,
such as maple, cherry, poplar, and birch. It is the difference
in the character and structure of these layers
which makes some woods hard and others soft, some
with open and others with close grain, and which also,
with the coloring matter peculiar to each kind of wood,
causes its individuality and adaptability to certain uses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
(The color and odor of wood are caused by chemical combinations,
and are not part of the substance of the wood.)</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f2">
<img src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.—Section of Yellow
Pine.</span></p>
<p class="caption"><i>a</i>, soft, cellular grain; <i>b</i>, hard, compact<br />
grain.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of these annual layers is composed of two parts,
the formation being shown in Fig. 1, in which the grain of
yellow pine is depicted. The soft, cellular, or open, grain,
<i>a</i>, is formed as the sap moves
upward in the spring, and the
hard, compact grain, <i>b</i>, is
formed later in the year. In
soft woods the open grain
predominates, while in hard
woods the compact grain is
more in evidence.</p>

<p>The age of a tree may be
determined by counting these
annual rings upon the stump,
though a drouth during the
growing season may have at
some time so affected its
growth as to make some layers
indistinct, rendering it impossible
to be absolutely sure of the count. In a young tree
the annual layers are thicker than when the tree becomes
more mature.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The different kinds of timber which the carpenter
uses are cut from <i>deciduous</i>, or broad-leaf, trees, and from
<i>coniferous</i>, or needle-leaf, trees. This classification of trees
is based upon the difference in the forms of their leaves,
the former kind furnishing the ash, oak, walnut, beech,
birch, and other woods that are hard to work, as well as
poplar or white wood, linn or bass wood, and others which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
are called hard woods, not in the sense that they are hard
to work, but because their method of growth is the same.</p>

<p>The <i>coniferous</i> or <i>evergreen</i> trees furnish the cedars,
pines, hemlocks, spruces, firs, redwood, tamarack, cypress,
and a few other woods of the same nature. These
woods have a resin which is always present, no matter
how old or dry the wood may be, which explains their
superior weather-resisting qualities.</p>

<p><b>2. The formation of wood.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) In the spring the sap
begins to flow upward, mainly through the open cells of
the cambium (the new growth in the stem, by which the
diameter of the tree is increased), and to some extent
through the sapwood. As it comes in contact with the
air by means of the leaves and the green shoots of the
tree, (<b>B.</b>) it gives off water and oxygen, and absorbs
carbonic acid gas from the air, (<b>C.</b>) which is formed into
starch, sugar, oil, etc.; this in turn becomes part of the
sapwood, and forms the compact part of the annual ring,
completing the layer for that year.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) The wood is formed by a deposit of matter from the
sap, which gradually thickens the cell walls until the cells
are filled, when that layer becomes a part of the heartwood,
or that part of the tree which is inclosed within the
annual layers of sapwood.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) Both the fibers and the cells of the sapwood are
filled with water or sap, which may be removed by seasoning,
but the sapwood of most trees used for building purposes
is not as good lumber as the heartwood, as it is
always susceptible to moisture. The exceptions to this
will be mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) In all unseasoned lumber from 20 to 60 per cent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
its weight is moisture, which must be evaporated before
the lumber has its highest commercial value. This may
be done by weather drying or by artificial means, the lumber
being treated in a specially constructed kiln.</p>

<p><b>3. Tissues.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) A tree trunk is composed of four
different tissues, viz.:</p>

<p>1. The <i>pith</i> (Fig. 2, <i>a</i>), a cellular tissue: this is worthless
and its presence in lumber is considered a defect.</p>

<p>2. The <i>wood</i>, which includes the heartwood (<i>b</i>), the
sapwood (<i>c</i>), and the medullary rays (<i>g</i>). From this part
of the tree the commercially valuable lumber is taken.</p>

<p>3. The <i>cambium</i> (<i>d</i>), which is a thin layer between the
sapwood (<i>c</i>) and the bast (<i>e</i>).</p>

<p>4. The <i>bark</i>, which includes both the bast (<i>e</i>) and
the outer bark (<i>f</i>). The bark of most trees is worthless,
but that of chestnut, oak, hemlock, and other trees which
are rich in tannic acid is used in large quantities by
tanneries.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The heartwood (<i>b</i>), or <i>duramen</i>, of most trees is
the part generally used by carpenters upon the best work.
It is firm, compact, and of the color and qualities characteristic
of the wood.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The sapwood (<i>c</i>), or <i>alburnum</i>, is generally light-colored,
and in most building woods its presence is considered
a defect, though not in hickory, ash, maple, or
yellow pine, and a few other woods; in fact, in these woods
it is often preferred to the heartwood for many kinds of
work on account of its color. The alburnum is filled
with the active elements of the sap, which are deposited
as the sap passes through the trees, and in time becomes
part of the duramen, or heartwood. The time required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
for sapwood to attain maturity ranges from thirty to one
hundred years, according to its kind and age.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f3">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.—Section of Oak Tree Trunk.</span></p>
<p class="caption1"><i>a</i>, pith; <i>b</i>, heartwood, or duramen; <i>c</i>, sapwood, or alburnum; <i>d</i>, cambium; <i>e</i>, bast, or
inner bark; <i>f</i>, outer bark, or corky layer; <i>g</i>, medullary rays, or silver grain; <i>po</i>, plain oak;
<i>qo</i>, quartered oak.</p>
</div>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Outside of the sapwood (Fig. 2, <i>c</i>) is the cambium
(<i>d</i>), which furnishes the substance upon which the
life of the tree depends. Here, nourished by the richest
sap, new cells are formed, which become either sapwood
or a part of the bast. (<b>E.</b>) At (<i>e</i>) is shown the bast or
inner bark, which is composed of a woody fiber combined
with a tissue of cells. This is elastic, which allows it to
expand as the wood grows beneath it. Outside of the
bast is the bark (<i>f</i>), or outer covering, which is of a corky
nature, and protects the delicate vital parts of the tree.</p>

<p><b>4. The medullary rays.</b>—Every tree has <i>medullary
rays</i> (Fig. 2, <i>g</i>), usually spoken of by wood-workers as
the “silver streak,” or “silver grain.” These rays connect
the center of the tree with the outside, and are
more prominent in such woods as oak, beech, and sycamore
than in other woods. It is to take advantage of
the beauty which these medullary rays impart that so
much quarter-sawed lumber is used, though lumber sawed
in this way is preferred for other reasons, which will be
discussed later.</p>

<p>In many woods these rays are so small as to be invisible
to the naked eye, as in pine, for instance, which has fifteen
thousand to the square inch. Aside from adding much to
the beauty of the lumber, they also give strength; if
lumber is dried out too rapidly by artificial heat, it is
apt to <i>check</i>, or crack, upon the line of the medullary
rays.</p>

the method by which the annual layers gradually cover broken branches; <i>e</i>, hard knot.</p>
</div>

<p><b>5. The grain in trees.</b>—In open or exposed situations
trees usually grow more or less gnarled or crooked, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>tends to improve the grain. The strength of lumber
cut from trees grown as described is impaired, however,
as the wood is more cross-grained than that from trees
which grow in the heart of a forest, with practically the
same conditions on all sides. As forest trees are continually
reaching up for the sunlight, they grow taller and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
straighter, which makes it possible for straighter-grained
lumber to be cut from them, and as the branches are at
the top, where they receive the sunlight and air, there are
few cross-grained places.</p>

<p>When the annual rings are large, the grain is said to be
<i>coarse</i>, and if the rings are fine, the term <i>fine-grained</i> is
used to describe it. When the direction of the fibers is
nearly parallel with the sides and the edges of the board,
it is said to be <i>straight-grained</i>; when the lumber is taken
from a crooked tree, it is said to be <i>cross-grained</i>, as the
grain follows the shape of the log, while the board is sawed
straight. Cross-grained lumber is the handsomer; in this
the fibers, being at different angles with the surface of
the board, form a variety of figures, which add much to the
beauty of the wood.</p>

<p><b>6. Defects found in lumber.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Some of the most
common defects found in lumber are <i>wind shakes</i>, or <i>cup
shakes</i> (Fig. 3, <i>a</i>), which are cracks following the line of
the porous part of the annual rings. These are caused
by the action of severe winds. (<b>B.</b>) <i>Heart shakes</i> (Fig.
3, <i>b</i>) are cracks radiating from the center of the tree, and
may be found in any kind of wood, as they are the result
of deficient nutrition, or loss of vitality. (<b>C.</b>) <i>Star
shakes</i> (Fig. 3, <i>c</i>) are caused by the shrinkage of the tree
upon the outside, which is the result of a long dry spell
of intense cold, or of the deficient action of the sap. Star
shakes differ from heart shakes in being larger upon the
outside of the tree; the heart shakes are larger at the
center.</p>

<p>Shakes of all kinds are common defects and sometimes
are so numerous as to make the log worthless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) <i>Discolorations</i> are caused by decay which has at
some time gained a foothold, but which the tree was
sufficiently vigorous to overcome; or they may be due to
imperfect or insufficient nutrition, which generally results
in the entire tree being affected instead of small
places upon the tree.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) Timber grown in a damp, marshy locality is generally
of a poorer quality than that grown upon higher
ground, as more water is taken up by the roots than
can be well assimilated, which prevents the formation
of healthy compact wood. Some woods are adapted to
such soil, the poplar or whitewood, willow, basswood,
buckeye, and cypress being denizens of moist or swampy
places.</p>

<p>Trees growing where they are exposed to winds from
one direction are apt to assume a spiral growth, which
renders the timber almost worthless, as it is weak, and
twists badly in drying.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) Trees which have lumps appearing like growths
upon them are usually unhealthy. These lumps, or
tumors, may be caused by defective nutrition, checks, or
shakes, or by the depredations of animals or insects.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) <i>Clefts</i>, or <i>splits</i>, in a tree may be caused by extreme
cold, heat, or drouth. They may extend into the tree
several inches, and while the blemish will always remain,
showing a discoloration or other defect, nature often
repairs it so that the strength of the timber is but slightly
affected. If these clefts are not healed, rain may find
lodgment there, and the sap be so affected that the adjacent
wood will be destroyed, and this in time will destroy
the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>(<b>H.</b>) Eggs of certain insects are also deposited in these
clefts, the larvæ of which bore into the wood and destroy
it. (<b>I.</b>) If it were not for the birds and other natural
enemies of these insects, they would increase so rapidly
that the lumber supply would be seriously affected, and,
as it is, there are very few trees which are not injured to
some extent by wood borers. The United States Bureau
of Entomology estimates that the damage to trees by
these pests amounts to at least $100,000,000 annually.</p>

<p>(<b>K.</b>) Sometimes (as at <i>d</i>, Fig. 3) branches die or are
broken off; this gives the elements access to the heart of
the tree and usually causes a permanent injury, as the
birds and other denizens of the forest frequently dig out
the rotten wood as soon as the weather has had time to
do its work, thus giving further opportunity for decay to
continue its destructive action. If this does not happen,
the wood will grow over the break after several years and
leave a loose knot in the heart of the tree, which will be
a decided blemish when the log is made into lumber. The
sketch shows the endeavor of nature to repair the defect,
as the annual rings will eventually close over the break.</p>

<p>The hard knot at <i>e</i>, Fig. 3, is not a serious defect, unless
the wood is to be used for finish or where great strength
is required.</p>

<p><b>7. When to cut lumber.</b>—Trees which are intended
for the use of wood-workers should not be felled while the
sap is in motion. If cut at any other time than midsummer
or in winter, the active sap is apt to sour and to
cause decay. Owing to the scarcity of lumber, or from
avarice, this precaution often is ignored, and trees are
felled at any time of year, regardless of their age; in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
cases, much of the lumber lacks the essential qualities of
its kind.</p>

<p>When a tree shows signs of dying at the top, it should be
cut down, as the quality of the lumber it contains will
deteriorate rapidly.</p>

<p><b>8. The manufacture of lumber</b>.—(<b>A.</b>) There are two
distinct processes in the preparation of lumber for commercial
purposes, <i>logging</i> and <i>sawing</i>; the former includes
all the steps from
felling the tree to the
delivery of the logs
at the sawmill; there
the logs are sawed
into boards, planks,
and timbers of certain
dimensions,
which are piled and
exposed to the sun
and air for a sufficient
time to allow a
large part of the
water in them to
evaporate, when the
lumber is said to be
“weather dried,”
and ready for shipment
to the consumer.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f5">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.—Felling a Tree.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) If a lumber
concern desires to
begin operations in
one of the great forest
areas, a “land-looker”
or “timber-cruiser”
is sent to
spy out the land,
and to report upon
the probable yield of
timber within certain
areas, and the conditions
which would
aid or retard the
work of getting out
the logs. If the report
is favorable, the
standing timber may
be purchased by
“stumpage,” which means that a certain price will be
paid for each thousand feet of lumber cut, or the land
may be purchased outright, though in the early history of
lumbering cases have been known where these little formalities
were omitted.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f6">
<img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.—Cutting Small Branches from<br />
Felled Spruce.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Camps are located at convenient points throughout the
boundary, roads are made through the woods, and foundations,
or “skidways,” built at right angles to them, to
receive the logs as they are hauled down the “travoy”
roads, which are narrow trails cut through the woods at
frequent distances for this purpose.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The above preparations completed, the work of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>felling the trees is begun (Fig. 4); this part of the work
requires nice skill and judgment, as it is necessary that
the tree should fall so that it will cause the least damage
to itself and to surrounding trees. After the tree is down,
the branches are cut
close to the trunk (Fig.
5) and carried to one
side so that they will
not be in the way
of the horses. The
trunk is then sawed
into logs, twelve, fourteen,
sixteen, or eighteen
feet in length,
as the imperfections
and the length of the
tree trunk may allow.
Longer or shorter logs
are rarely cut except
for special purposes.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) One end of the
log is placed upon a
drag, or is gripped by
a pair of tongs, and
hauled to the nearest
travoy road and skidway, where it is piled (Fig. 6).
(<b>E.</b>) From the skidway the logs are loaded upon trucks,
cars, or sledges (Fig. 7), and carried to the cable (Fig. 8),
which is a method of hauling logs used in some parts of
the country, or to the railroad (Fig. 9), or floated down a
river (Fig. 10). If either of these latter methods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
transportation is employed, the logs are generally piled
upon another skidway until there is enough for a train
load, or until the conditions upon the river are favorable
for them to be floated to the mill.</p>

</div>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) Figure 11 illustrates a jam of logs, which is generally
the most dangerous obstacle the lumberman has to
face. A jam usually depends upon one key log, which,
if loosened, will allow the jam to break instantly. The
work of loosening the key log is frequently done by one
or two men, who must be men of spring steel nerves and
muscles, and possessed of the highest possible skill and
activity, or they cannot hope to break a large jam
and escape with their lives.</p>

<img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.—Sawmill in the Big Tree District.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) The mill illustrated by Fig. 12 is one which receives
its logs by both rail and river. In this case the
logs which come in by rail are rolled into the river, as
they can be more easily placed upon the chain feed of
the mill. In winter, a small pond of water is heated, in
which the logs are soaked before they are taken into the
mill; this draws the frost out of them, and allows them
to be worked much more easily.</p>

<p>(<b>H.</b>) There are different types of sawmills, in which
the logs are worked into commercial shapes. The small
enterprises use portable mills, which are moved into the
woods and located upon a tract of land, remaining until
all the desirable timber in the vicinity has been sawed, and
then moved to another locality and the process repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Large operations are conducted upon a different plan;
mills of a permanent type are erected as near the forest
as practicable, roads are built, tracks laid, and the logs
brought from the woods by one of the methods previously
illustrated; or, where it is feasible, flumes are built,
and the logs floated in these to the mill. In erecting a
mill of this sort, a location is selected upon a waterway if
possible, as the logs may be floated more cheaply than by
any other method of transportation, though some of the
heavier woods will not float, and have to be handled on
land. (<b>I.</b>) The immersion of logs in water also improves
the quality of the lumber, as the action of the water upon
the sap prevents to some degree the tendency to decay,
and also facilitates the seasoning of the manufactured
product. If the log is left in the water until it becomes
water-logged, it will sink, and while it is not injured for
many purposes, the wood loses some of the strength which
it is supposed to have. In many localities, the salvage
of sunken logs has become an industry.</p>

<p>(<b>J.</b>) In modern large lumbering operations, the timber to
be cut is selected by trained foresters, thus insuring a permanent
supply, and in the near future all extensive lumbering
operations will, beyond doubt, be conducted upon
a scientific basis, as it is apparent that unless lumbering
is carried on differently than it has been in the past, the
supply for the future will be entirely inadequate for the
demand.</p>

<p>(<b>K.</b>) In the smaller sawmills, the logs are usually sawed
into lumber of various dimensions by a circular saw
(Fig. 13); but in the larger mills, the band saw generally
is used. Figure 14 illustrates a double cut band sawmill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in which it will be seen that the saw makes a cut each time
the log is carried either way.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f14">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.—Circular Saw.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>9. To saw lumber of irregular dimensions.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Besides
sawing dimension timber, joists, scantlings, boards,
and planks of different
thicknesses are
sawed, as follows:
1”, 1¼”, 1½”, 2”,
2½”, 3”, 3½”, 4”; and
thicker, if desired.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) If lumber is
cut again from its
original dimensions,
it is said to be <i>resawed</i>.
When boards
or planks of the
above dimensions are
dressed on both sides,
they will be about
⅛” thinner; thus, a
board sawed 1” thick
will, when seasoned
and dressed, be but ⅞”, and a 2” plank will be but 1⅞”
or 1¾”, though still classed by their sawed dimensions.</p>

<p>Thicker lumber than that above-mentioned usually
comes under the head of dimension timber, which is not
used to the extent that it was formerly, as steel and concrete
are replacing it upon heavy work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f15">
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.—Double Cut Band Saw.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If ½” boards are wanted, 1¼” or “five quarter” lumber
is usually resawed to furnish it, and after resawing, is
planed upon each side to the desired thickness. Boards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
for box stock and other special purposes are sometimes
sawed as thin as ¼”.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f16">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.—Plain,
Slash, or Bastard
Sawing.</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.—Four
Methods of
Quartering.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The method of cutting a log illustrated by Fig.
15 is known as <i>plain</i>, <i>slash</i>, or <i>bastard sawing</i>, and is
the cheapest way to cut logs, both as to time and waste.
The log is first squared to secure a bed upon which it may
lie while being sawed,
which also makes it unnecessary
to run each
board by the edging
saw to straighten the
edges. The slabs at <i>a</i>
are sawed into boards
as the log is squared,
and the bark, or “live
edges,” sawed off afterward. These make an inferior
grade of boards, as they are nearly all sap, but they
are well worth saving, if large logs are being cut.</p>

<p>In sawing dimension timber, or “bill stuff,” good judgment
is necessary to cut a log so that the greatest amount
of marketable lumber can be made from it. This is done
by cutting various sizes from a log, if it will not cut all of
one size without too much waste.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) In cutting woods which have prominent medullary
rays or silver grain, the log is sawed by one of the
methods shown in Fig. 16, the object being to bring the
rays as nearly parallel to the surface of the board as
possible, thus giving the broad silver, or quarter, grain
which is so highly prized.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained from sections <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; this
method also gives the most waste. In plain sawed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
lumber, the boards from the middle of the log will
have the quarter grain; these are usually culled and
sold as quarter-sawed.</p>

<p>Neither of these methods results in economy of time
or material, as about 25 per cent of each is used in
excess of that required in plain sawing; hence, quarter-sawed
lumber is more expensive than the plain, or bastard,
sawed.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) Quarter-sawed lumber (Fig. 16) is preferred not
only on account of its handsomer grain, but because it
holds its shape better than lumber sawed in any other
way, as the annual layers are approximately square
with the surface of the board. As the board shrinks
in the direction parallel with the annual layers, and
very little from the center to the outside of the tree,
it is obvious that there is much less shrinking and
warping in quarter-sawed lumber than in that which
is sawed plain.</p>

<p>The best grades of flooring are quarter-sawed, and stand
usage without the surface splintering much better than
does the common plain sawed material. Quarter-sawed
lumber is known also as “rift-sawed,” “vertical grain,”
and “comb grained.”</p>

<p><b>10. The grading of lumber.</b>—Custom varies somewhat
in different localities as to the grading of lumber, but
there are generally four grades, which are often subgraded
into qualities suitable for various uses.</p>

<p>“Number 1” lumber should be practically perfect,
though in large dimensions, small and unimportant blemishes
may be allowed. These blemishes in a board are
usually restricted to not more than one inch of sap, a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
sound knot, or small discoloration, and but one blemish
to a board is allowed.</p>

<p>“Number 2” lumber is generally allowed two sound
knots, an inch of sap, and one other blemish.</p>

<p>“Common boards” are allowed three or four sound
knots, but two thirds of one side must be clear stock.</p>

<p>“Culls,” the lowest grade, are used only upon the
cheapest work. One half of the board must be usable.</p>

<p>In many cases the boards are graded by the width of
clear stock which can be taken out. There are tables
published by the different associations of lumber manufacturers
which give the gradings under which their lumber
has been measured and shipped, but as these vary
from time to time no permanent list can be given.</p>

<p>The principal reason why there can be no permanent
grading of lumber is that the forests from which the finest
timber can be cut in marketable quantities are being
destroyed faster than they can be replaced by nature. In
anticipation of this condition, the Division of Forestry of
the Department of Agriculture is actively engaged in
organizing government forest preserves, in educating the
people, and in promoting legislation aimed at the husbanding
of our forests. When we consider the abundance of high
grade lumber a few years ago, and the fabulous prices
which the same grades now bring, it is evident that this
movement should have begun during the days of our
grandfathers, instead of waiting until nearly all the best
lumber in the great forests east of the Mississippi had
been cut, and inestimable damage wrought by forest fires.</p>

<p><b>11. The testing of lumber.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Dry, sound stock,
if struck with the knuckles or with a hammer, will give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
clear ringing response, while a wet or decaying piece will
give a dull response to the blow.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Every kind of lumber has its peculiar odor, by
which, as well as by the grain, the student should learn
to distinguish the woods in common use. This may be
more easily done before the wood has been thoroughly
seasoned. Wood in general has a sweet and pleasing
odor; if a sour or musty smell is perceptible, it indicates
that decay is present.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) If there is much variation in the color of timber,
or black and blue spots, the stick is probably diseased.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Decay is a disease, which may be prevented by
dryness or ventilation, and frequently may be cured by
soaking the wood in water for several days, or by steaming.
The disease of decay is cured also by chemical preservatives
being forced into lumber by pressure; this at
the same time prevents insects from boring into the tree.</p>

<p>Alternate wetting and drying will produce rot, but most
lumber, if permanently submerged or if kept perfectly dry,
will last almost indefinitely. Dry rot spreads to adjoining
timbers, and even to those which have no connection
with the one originally infected.</p>

<p><b>12. Surveying or estimating lumber.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) It is the
custom to consider any board less than one inch in thickness
as an inch board, and anything over one inch is
measured as so many inches and fractions of an inch.
For instance, a board ¾” thick is surveyed as a full inch,
while one which is sawed 1½” in thickness is estimated by
obtaining its surface measure, and increasing it by one half.
Thus, a plank 12’ long, 8” wide, and 1½” thick would have
twelve feet board measure in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>In some localities there is a sliding scale of prices which
varies with each quarter inch in thickness of resawed
lumber, but this is not universal.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In surveying joists or scantling, it is customary
to obtain the fraction of a foot, board measure, for each
lineal foot. Thus, a piece of 2 × 4 (inches understood)
has two thirds of a foot for each foot in length; a 2 × 6 has
one foot, and a piece of 2 × 8 has one and one third feet of
lumber for each foot in length of lumber measured. If a
joist is 2 × 12, doubling its length gives the number of
square feet, board measure, that the joist contains.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) In measuring a common board, the widest parallel
piece which can be cut from it is the width of the board
being measured; therefore the board should be surveyed
at the narrowest place. In measuring more expensive
lumber, it is customary to average the width of the board.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) In estimating all kinds of lumber in common
use, the lumber scale shown in Fig. 17 is used. It is
made of thin, cleft hickory, about three feet long, with
one end large enough for a suitable handle; on the other
end is a metal head, which is held against the edge of the
board while the scale is being read.</p>

<p>The length of the board is marked near the handle, and
at the end of the socket of the metal head, as at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>In using this scale, the hooked end, or head, is held
against the edge of the board, as at <i>b</i>; the eye follows
along the same line of figures upon which the length of the
board is found, reading those figures nearest the width of
the board. Thus, a scale laid upon a board 16’ long
would, without further measuring or calculating, show that
the board contains 17’ board measure. If the board were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
12’ long, it would contain 13’; and if 14’ long, by reading
the middle line of figures, the board would be seen to contain
15’.</p>

<p>In using this scale, it is customary to read to the nearest
figure, and when there is no difference, to alternate between
the lower and the higher figures upon different
boards. Thus, a board 12’ long and 8¾” or 9¼” wide
would be read as having 9’ board measure in it. Two
boards 8½” wide, of the same length as the above, would
be measured as having 8’ and 9’, respectively, in their
surfaces. In short, the fractions of a foot are not considered
in surveying the lumber in common use.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.—Lumber Scale.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>13. Qualities of wood.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Certain kinds of wood
are adapted for some purposes better than are others;
the wood-worker, therefore, should be familiar with the
qualities which conditions demand, and the kinds of woods
which have these qualities.</p>

<p>Lumber for framing should be strong and durable; it
should be cut from trees which grow to a size that will
allow large dimensions to be cut from them.</p>

<p>For outside finish, the material should be wood which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
will stand the weather, can be easily worked, and will
hold its shape well.</p>

<p>Timbers that are to be buried must possess the quality
of durability, and should be of sufficient strength to resist
the strain which will be put upon them.</p>

<p>Flooring should wear well, hold its shape, and be of
good appearance. In providing lumber for inside finish,
care should be used that it has good grain and color, is
not too soft, and that it will hold its shape well. Almost
any wood may be used as far as strength is concerned,
but lumber which shrinks and warps badly is
unfit for finishing.</p>

<p>Shingles should be of wood which will resist decay, and
which has the least tendency to warp and split.</p>

<p>Boards which are to be used for siding should hold paint
well, and be as free as possible from the tendency to warp,
split, and twist when exposed to the weather.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) All material used in framing a building should be
weather-dried in good drying weather for at least thirty
days for each inch in thickness, and that used for inside and
outside finish and floors should be thoroughly kiln-dried,
and kept in a dry place until ready for use. These conditions
are not always obtainable, but if the best results
are desired, they should be followed as closely as possible.</p>

<p>The woods hereafter described comprise the principal
varieties used by the wood-workers of the United States.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) <i>Ash</i> (deciduous, or broad-leaved) is an open-grained,
light-colored wood, in which the porous portions
of the annual rings are quite prominent, thus making it
somewhat coarse-grained.</p>

<p>It grows in the Northern states, and is a wood of medium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
weight and hardness. It is tough and elastic, the young
growth being much used in the manufacture of wagons,
machinery frames, and for similar purposes, as it is not
expensive, quite easily worked, and very strong. It
has a tendency to decay, and is often badly infested with
insects; therefore it is not suitable for building construction
or for contact with soil.</p>

<p>Ash grows in forests with other broad-leaved trees,
and is plentiful in many localities. There are two kinds
of this wood recognized in commerce: the <i>white</i>, which is
light-colored, and the <i>black</i>, which is of a brownish tinge,
though there is little difference in the grain of the two.
Sap is not considered a defect, but is regarded as the best
part of the tree for some purposes. The wood grown in
the Northern states is generally tougher than that grown
farther south.</p>

<p>The wood from the older and larger trees is not so
tough and hard as that from the younger growth, and is
much used for cabinet work and for interior finish. It
should be filled with a paste-filler, after which it may be
brought to a fine polish. The wood holds its shape well
and is useful for the purposes mentioned.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) <i>Apple</i> (dec.) is not used for construction, as the
proper dimensions cannot be secured, and as it is very
stubborn to work. It is one of the best woods known to resist
splitting, and is much used for chisel and saw handles.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) <i>Basswood</i>, or <i>linden</i> (dec.), is a soft, porous wood,
which shrinks considerably in drying. It is used for the
backing of veneer work, for drawer bottoms of the common
grades of furniture, for case backs, and similar purposes,
and is also much used in the manufacture of spools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
and other small articles which are made in large quantities.
In building construction, basswood is used for ceilings,
and for other work where strength is not needed,
though for use in such places it should be thoroughly
seasoned, or the joints will open.</p>

<p>If steamed, basswood may be bent to almost any form.
Steaming also cures to a great extent the tendency of
this wood to shrink and swell.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) <i>Beech</i> (dec.) is adapted for use in places where the
ability to resist a heavy strain or hard wear is necessary,
as in plane stocks, tool handles, and parts of machinery.
In building work, it is used to some extent for flooring and
for inside finishing. It is used also for furniture, though
the difficulty of working it makes it more expensive than
other equally desirable woods.</p>

<p>If exposed to alternations of dryness and dampness, it
decays rapidly; if submerged, it gives fair satisfaction.</p>

<p>Beech trees are common through the Ohio and Mississippi
valleys, and are found to some extent in all of the
states between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) <i>Birch</i> (dec.) is one of our most useful hard woods.
It is found in abundance in the broad-leaved forests of
the Eastern states and Canada. There are two varieties
recognized in commerce, the <i>red</i> and the <i>white birch</i>.
The former is used considerably for inside finish and for
furniture. It takes a stain well, and may be made to
imitate cherry or mahogany so exactly as to deceive any
one but an expert. When finished in its own natural color,
it is a satisfactory wood for the above uses, but as it ages,
it turns to a muddy brown; as it is a stubborn wood to
work, it is not popular.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><i>Canoe</i>, or <i>paper</i>, <i>birch</i> is softer than the red variety,
and is used to some extent by paper pulp makers, and
for the manufacture of spools, dowels, and a large variety
of small articles.</p>

<p>(<b>H.</b>) <i>Butternut</i> or <i>white walnut</i> (dec.) has a good grain
and color; it is quite soft, though not so easily worked as
are some harder woods, for it has a tendency to string while
being dressed to a fine surface. It does not absorb moisture
readily, and holds its shape under trying conditions.</p>

<p>Butternut does not split easily, takes a fine polish, and
is used considerably for furniture and for interior finish.</p>

<p>(<b>I.</b>) <i>Cedar</i> (coniferous, or needle-leaved) is of two
varieties, the <i>red</i> and the <i>white</i>. The former is used considerably
for cooperage and veneers, lead pencils, and for
lining moth-proof drawers and chests, as its strong odor and
bitter taste protects it from the ravages of insects. The
supply of red cedar is becoming limited, and it is now too
expensive for common use, though our forefathers used it
for shingles. The unwise and avaricious cutting of this
valuable timber and of others, notably white and Georgia
pine, has destroyed what would have been a supply for
all time, if the cutting had been properly controlled.</p>

<p>White cedar is much more plentiful, and a much inferior
wood; it is used for shingles, water tanks, boat building,
and in the manufacture of barrels and cigar boxes. It is
a very durable wood, and shrinks but little in drying. It
is well adapted for burying, though not strong enough to
resist a very heavy strain. It grows faster than the red
cedar, and makes a larger tree.</p>

<p>(<b>J.</b>) <i>Cherry</i> (dec.) is one of the best of our native woods.
It is much used for fine finish and for cabinet work, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
holds its shape well, if thoroughly seasoned, and takes a
fine finish. Its grain is of fine, even texture, of reddish
color, and often stained to imitate mahogany. When
well ebonized, it cannot be distinguished from the genuine
wood except by weight.</p>

<p>Cherry is used by pattern makers for parts of patterns
which are to stand rough usage. The tree is found in all
of the states east of Texas, and in the Mississippi valley,
but it is becoming too scarce for common use.</p>

<p>(<b>K.</b>) <i>Chestnut</i> (dec.) is a soft, open-grained wood,
adapted to use in exposed situations. It is used a great
deal for inside finish, as it will take a fine polish, and as
the figures formed by the grain make it a very handsome
wood for the purpose.</p>

<p>Not being a strong wood, it will not stand a heavy
strain, and will shrink and crack badly in drying.</p>

<p>(<b>L.</b>) <i>Cypress</i> (con.) is similar to cedar. It is one of our
most durable woods, and perhaps the best we have for
outside work. It is used extensively for shingles; roofs
covered with cypress shingles have been known to last for
more than seventy-five years. The wood is light, straight-grained,
and soft; it is easily worked, and holds its shape
well. It is to great extent taking the place of white pine
in the manufacture of doors, sash, and blinds, and is considered
by many to be equal, if not superior, to that wood.
It is much used in building small boats, and for use in
places where it will be exposed to dampness. Eaves,
troughs, and tanks made of it give better satisfaction than
those made of any other woods except redwood and cedar,
which are the only woods having anti-decaying qualities
equal to cypress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Cypress may be obtained in boards of almost any dimensions,
and if it were stronger and harder, it would be one
of our best woods for framing and finishing. It is used for
the latter purpose to a considerable extent, as it has a
handsome grain, and will take a polish well; if thoroughly
seasoned, it will hold its shape as well as any wood. If
it is seasoned slowly, it does not crack to an appreciable
extent, but if forced, it is apt to be filled with fine shakes.
Sap is not considered a blemish.</p>

<p>Cypress grows in the swamps and along the rivers of the
Southern states, the best of it coming from those bordering
on the gulf.</p>

<p>(<b>M.</b>) <i>Elm</i> (dec.) is a moderately hard wood, difficult to
split. It warps and checks to some extent in drying, but
when well seasoned it holds its shape as well as most woods
in common use. It is susceptible to a good polish, and is
used a great deal for interior finish and furniture, as it
takes a stain well. Much of the quartered oak used in
the manufacture of cheap furniture grew upon an elm
stump. It is used largely in cooperage, and stands contact
with the soil satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The elm is found in nearly all parts of the United States,
but is more abundant east of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>(<b>N.</b>) <i>Gum</i> (dec.), or, as it is more generally known,
<i>sweet gum</i>, is extensively used for interior finish upon the
better class of buildings. It warps and shrinks badly unless
thoroughly seasoned, in which condition it is a very
satisfactory wood. It is tough and strong, cross-grained,
and of fine texture; its color is a warm, reddish brown,
and it finishes handsomely. The gum tree grows abundantly
in the Southern states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>(<b>O.</b>) <i>Hemlock</i> (con.) is found in most of the Northern
states, and is used for scantlings, rough boards, under
floors, and for boarding preparatory to siding. It is a
fairly durable wood, but splits easily, and is apt to be full
of wind shakes. It holds nails firmly.</p>

<p>(<b>P.</b>) <i>Hickory</i> (dec.) is the hardest native wood in common
use, and the toughest wood that we have; it is too
hard to be used for building material. It is flexible, and its
principal use is for wagon and carriage work, and for other
purposes where bent wood and great strength is required.
As it does not split easily, it is much used in the manufacture
of tool handles. It is liable to attacks from boring insects,
and these pests often destroy much valuable timber.</p>

<p>Sap is not considered a defect, and the sapwood is in
fact the most desirable part of the tree, on account of its
creamy whiteness and great strength.</p>

<p>(<b>Q.</b>) <i>Locust</i> (dec.) is found in nearly all parts of the
country, and is a useful and durable wood. It is much
used for fence posts and, in damp locations, for railway
ties, and sometimes for furniture, as it has a yellowish
brown color which takes a polish well.</p>

<p>(<b>R.</b>) <i>Maple</i> (dec.) is a heavy, strong wood, nearly white,
with a yellow or brownish tinge. There are several kinds
of maple, but the kind generally used for commercial
purposes is the <i>sugar</i> or <i>rock maple</i>. It does not shrink
excessively, seasons without serious checking, and from it
a very fine surface for polishing may be obtained. It is
much used in places where it is exposed to wear, as in
floors, butchers’ tables, etc., and to a considerable extent
as a cabinet wood, and for interior finish. Maple does
not resist decay as well as do some other woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Sap is not considered a defect, and on account of its
whiteness the sapwood is often preferred to the heartwood
for many uses.</p>

<p><i>Bird’s-eye maple</i> is of this wood, but some peculiarity
in the growth of certain trees, believed by many to be caused
by woodpeckers, has caused the tree to have what seem
to be numerous small knots, known as curls or eyes. The
presence of these imparts a beauty which is possessed by no
other wood, and has never been successfully imitated.</p>

<p>(<b>S.</b>) <i>Mahogany</i> (dec.) is an imported wood, and is
much used in the finish of fine buildings and in the manufacture
of fine furniture. It is of a rich red color, and has
a beautiful grain and other desirable qualities which make
it the finest wood for finish in use. It holds its shape
remarkably well, unless it is very cross-grained, and is in
every respect an ideal cabinet wood. Its cost is all that
prevents it from being universally used.</p>

<p>(<b>T.</b>) <i>Oak</i> (dec.) is our best all-round native wood. It
is found abundantly in nearly all parts of the country,
and forms the larger part of our broad-leaved forests.
There are a number of species of oak, but they are in general
known to commerce as the <i>red</i> and the <i>white oak</i>. Nearly
all these trees are cut for commercial purposes, but the
white oak is the finest. The wood of some varieties of
oak is so similar to the white oak that the difference cannot
be distinguished after the work is finished, therefore
they are all put together and sold as a medium grade of
white oak for purposes where the strength of the genuine
is not required. This will generally account for the difference
in the grain and the color which is noticed in
handling the commercial white oak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Red oak is a coarser wood, and is more apt to give trouble
in seasoning than white oak, though they both have to be
dried very carefully, or there may be checks and cracks
to such an extent that the wood will be ruined. Both
the red and the white oak are used extensively in finishing
and cabinet work, but the red oak is used commonly
upon the cheaper grades, as it is easier to work.</p>

<p>The two varieties should never be used upon the same
job, unless the wood is to be stained a dark color, as
there is a marked difference in their appearance when
finished. White oak is much used for flooring, quartered
oak resulting in a beautiful floor, if the work is well done.</p>

<p>Oak is not a suitable wood for exposure to trying climatic
conditions, though if buried deeply, or in water,
where there is no alteration in moisture or dryness, it
gives satisfaction. White oak is used to great extent for
railroad ties, but what these are to be made of in the future
is causing much speculation, as the end of the present
supply of white oak is already in sight.</p>

<p>(<b>U.</b>) <i>Pine</i> (con.) in its different varieties is used more
than any other kind of wood. It is found in nearly all
parts of the United States and in Canada. Certain sections
of the country which were once covered with virgin
pine forests have, however, been so denuded of their
wealth, and so many of their young trees destroyed,
within a few short years, by the depredations of lumbermen
who cared more for their immediate profit than for
the prospective good of the nation, that instead of a permanent
and continual supply of this valuable wood, there
are now nothing but barren hillsides, and the moss-grown
ruins of the lumber camps and sawmills by means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
which this irremediable wrong was perpetrated against
posterity.</p>

<p><i>White pine</i> is soft, easily worked, and when thoroughly
seasoned will hold its shape better than any other wood
except mahogany. For these reasons, and on account of
its adaptability to gluing, it is used almost exclusively by
pattern makers. It is found in the Northern states and
in Canada. Farther south is the belt in which grows
the grade of pine known as “Carolina,” the <i>bastard</i> or
<i>yellow pine</i>. This belt extends from the Mississippi
valley to the Atlantic coast, and is of a width to include
Virginia and the Carolinas. This pine is harder to work,
and has a more pronounced grain than has the white pine,
but it makes a handsome wood for interior trim, as it is
capable of a fine finish. Carolina pine is neither so hard
nor so strong as “Georgia” pine, which is also known
commercially as <i>long-leaved pine</i>, <i>pitch pine</i>, or <i>hard pine</i>.
This wood is found from Virginia to Texas, in the states
bordering upon the ocean and the gulf.</p>

<p>Pitch pine has a finer, closer grain than has either of the
two above described, being much stronger and more dense.
This is the wood which is used for heavy timbers of large
buildings, and the above described grades should never
be confused with it, the Carolina pine resulting in work of
less strength, for instance, if used where the pitch pine
was intended. Although this wood is very hard and
strong, and is the best wood for heavy construction, as
has been stated, it should never be used in any place which
is not dry and well ventilated, as it will decay rapidly if
placed in a damp location, or where it will come in contact
with the earth.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>There are several varieties of pine besides those above
mentioned. These are generally less desirable for finish
or for construction than is the white, yellow, or Carolina
pine, but they are used extensively for the common work
of light building, and by box factories.</p>

<p>(<b>V.</b>) <i>Poplar</i> or <i>whitewood</i> (dec.) is cut from the tulip
tree, and is found principally in the Middle West and in
some parts of the South. It is of light weight and color,
with few knots, and is soft and easily worked. It is used
for the common grades of cabinet work, inside finishing,
veranda posts, etc. It takes a stain remarkably well, and
its even texture makes it a favorite with wood carvers.
It warps and shrinks considerably in seasoning, and
unless held in its place, it is apt to twist.</p>

<p>(<b>W.</b>) <i>Redwood</i> (con.) is taken from the big trees on the
Pacific slope; it is straight-grained, soft, and free from
knots, and may be obtained in boards of any size which
it is possible to cut. It has the reputation of being one of
the best woods for use in trying conditions, or where it
will be exposed to alternations of dryness and moisture.</p>

<p>It has a very coarse grain and takes a finish well, but
it is not apt to become very popular for inside finish, as it is
easily marred, and, although very soft, will, when thoroughly
dry, destroy the edge of tools quicker than many
harder woods. It turns to a dull, unattractive brown as
it ages, if it is finished in its natural color.</p>

<p>It is claimed by many to be the best wood for shingles,
as it resists decay indefinitely. It shrinks both ways of
the grain, and burns very slowly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f20">
<img src="images/fig20.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.—Douglas Spruce Forest.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>X.</b>) <i>Spruce</i> (con.) is moderately hard and strong, and
in New England is used generally for framing light buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and for rough boarding. Its color is almost pure
white, and it has the valuable quality of holding nails
firmly. There is little difference between the heart and
the sap wood, and its texture is sometimes such that it is
difficult to distinguish it from white pine. It warps and
twists badly in seasoning, and on that account is not suitable
for framing trusses, unless seasoned lumber is used.</p>

<p>Spruce is used also for a cheap grade of clapboards, for
flooring, ceiling, and laths, and also by paper pulp manufacturers
in immense quantities. It is a fairly satisfactory
wood for immersion, but if exposed to alternations of dryness
and moisture, it decays rapidly.</p>

<p>(<b>Y.</b>) <i>Sycamore</i>, or <i>buttonwood</i> (dec.), is found in nearly
all parts of the Mississippi valley and in the Eastern
states. It is a moderately stiff and strong wood, coarse-grained,
and quite difficult to smooth to a surface, as the
grain seems to run in all directions at once. It has also
a disagreeable habit of warping and twisting as it seasons,
but if well seasoned and properly handled, it will give no
more trouble than do other woods. It takes a good
polish, and is a desirable wood for inside finish.</p>

<p>(<b>Z.</b>) <i>Walnut</i>, or <i>black walnut</i> (dec.), is found in all the
Middle and Eastern states. It is heavy, firm, and strong,
of a chocolate color, and takes a fine finish. It is well
adapted to inside finish and to furniture work.</p>

<p>At one time nearly all the best work was done in this
wood, but at present it is out of style, as oak and other
woods are more in favor. Like other varieties of our best
woods, this has been cut out, and is now too expensive to
be considered as anything but a fancy wood.</p>

<p><i>White walnut</i> is described under butternut.</p>

<p class="c large"><span class="smcap">Care of Lumber</span></p>


<p><b>14. The piling of lumber.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) To the uninitiated it
may seem that the piling of lumber is work upon which it
is not necessary to expend much skill, but there are few
operations in which carelessness or ignorance will cause
more loss to a wood-worker.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The front end of a lumber pile should be higher
than the back, therefore it is a good plan to locate it upon
ground which falls away to the rear, or to build the ways
which support the pile so that the water which drives
into the pile will run out at the back end, and not stand
upon the boards, as this will cause discolorations.</p>

<p><b>15. Permanent lumber ways.</b>—These should be built
by some method similar to that shown in Fig. 22. It is
not a good plan to lay timbers upon the ground, as they
will decay rapidly, and there will not be sufficient room
for air to circulate under the pile to allow the boards of
the lower courses to dry out properly. The pile is also
apt to settle when the frost comes out of the ground in the
spring. Lumber should not be stacked above wet or
marshy ground; if necessary to stack it where the weeds
are of rank growth, the latter should be kept down.</p>

<p>The ways should be built with a solid foundation, well
below the frost line, though this is rarely done except for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
permanent lumber storage. This is shown at <i>a</i>, Fig. 22,
in which it will be seen that the ways are built to stand a
heavy load; the space between the centers of the ways
should be about five feet, as multiples of this distance will
accommodate any length of boards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f22">
<img src="images/fig22.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.—Permanent Lumber Ways.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>16. To minimize the warping of lumber.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Do
not place lumber piles less than one foot apart, as it is
necessary that there should be a continuous circulation of
air through the pile in all directions. (See <i>b</i>, Fig. 22.)</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Lumber piles are usually four feet in width, and
should be built up with sticks of that length, which are
placed between the courses of boards. It is important
that these be placed directly over each other and the ways;
otherwise there will be short kinks in the boards, as
shown at <i>c</i>. It is such carelessness as this that causes a
great deal of loss. In piling very expensive lumber, the
front sticks should be laid so as to project a little over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
course of boards below, and the boards of the course
above should project the same distance over the stick, in
order to give the front of the pile an inclination to the
front, as shown at <i>d</i>, which will allow most of the rain-water
to drop clear of the boards below, instead of running
down the front and finding its way into the pile.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Square piles are sometimes built, but in these the
boards should be laid with large spaces between them, to
allow perfect circulation of air. It is obvious that in a pile
of this sort, the boards in the center of the pile will not
come in contact with the air as much as those on the outside,
and that consequently, unless carefully piled, the
boards may be damaged by the moisture souring instead
of drying out, which usually results in decay.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) During the drying out process, all boards change
their form more or less, depending upon the shape of the
tree trunk, the kind and quality of the wood, the part of
the tree from which the log was cut, as well as its size and
age, the relation of the annual rings and medullary rays
to the surfaces of the board, the length of time since the
log was cut before being made into lumber, whether it
had lain in water for several months, and the method of
piling. Thus it will be seen that in every stage of preparing
lumber for market, a high degree of skill and
judgment is necessary to insure the best results.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.—Warping of<br />
Lumber.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The greatest deterioration in lumber, after it has been cut
and properly piled, is generally due to the tendency to
warp, the cause of which is indicated in Fig. 23, and which
may to great extent be minimized by skillful piling. If this
sketch is studied carefully, it will be noticed that the middle
board is thicker in the middle than it is at the edges, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
that the curves of its top and bottom sides are practically
uniform. This is because the annual layers are
at nearly a right angle with the sides of the board, which
causes the board to shrink in thickness, and very little
in width. This is due to the tendency of lumber
shrink around, or parallel with, the annual layers.
This tendency also causes the star
shakes, as at <i>c</i>, Fig. 3, which is
because the inner layers of the log,
being less than the outside layers in
circumference, and less exposed to
the dry air, do not shrink so fast nor
so much. This tendency is again
illustrated in Fig. 23, in which it will
be seen that because the outer
annual layers shrink faster, they
cause the outside of the board, or
the part which grew toward the outside of the tree, to
become narrower, and to assume a concave shape, while
the side nearer the center of the tree, or the inside of
the board, becomes convex. This is also the reason why
boards cut near the outside of the log will shrink in width
more than those cut nearer the center, which shrink in
thickness proportionately more than in width.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) For the purpose of taking advantage of the tendency
to warp, and applying it to its own remedy, boards
should be piled with the side which grew nearer the center
of the tree uppermost. This will help to correct the
tendency of the board to warp, as explained above, as the
side which would naturally assume the concave shape will
be underneath, and less likely to warp than if it were uppermost.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
This is not generally observed in stacking common
lumber, since it needs care and judgment to do it properly,
but it should be done if valuable lumber is being
handled.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f24">
<img src="images/fig24.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.—Lumber piled in Double<br />
Courses.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Boards of practically the same width, if less than 7”
wide, are sometimes stacked in double courses, as shown
in Fig. 24, the outside of
the boards, or the sides
which grew nearer the outside
of the tree being placed
together, thus allowing the
inside of the boards, or the
sides which grew toward the
center of the tree, to receive more air than the sides which
are placed together, and therefore to dry out faster, which
will reduce the warping to a minimum. After a pile is
completed, it should be covered with old boards to protect
the top courses from the weather.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) A pile of valuable lumber should be restacked
every six or eight months, as the boards are apt to become
discolored where the lumber sticks are placed; in this
rehandling, the warped boards should be placed with the
concave side underneath.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) If lumber is cut in winter or midsummer, and
properly cared for, it is not apt to be injured by any rain
which may drive into the pile, if there is free circulation of
air; nor is it so liable to decay as lumber which is cut at
other times of the year.</p>

<p><b>17. Weather-dried lumber.</b>—Lumber which has been
dried in the stack out of doors is not dry enough for use in
the manufacture of inside finish or furniture, as it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
dried out only to the degree of moisture in the outside air.
If it is then worked up and placed in an artificially heated
house, the heat will cause more moisture to evaporate,
the wood to shrink, and the joints to open. For material
to be used in the frames of buildings, in wagons, or in
other places where the greatest possible strength is required,
not less than two years weather-drying is preferred,
as the material retains its full strength.</p>

<p><b>18. Kiln-dried lumber.</b>—Lumber for furniture or for
inside finish should be seasoned by the process known as
“kiln-drying.” This means that lumber is exposed to a
temperature of from 120° to 200° F. by which the moisture
is extracted and evaporated. Lumber thus treated is
apt to be more or less weakened by the action of the heat
upon the fibers of the wood, which causes thousands of
minute fractures, and in many cases the life and the elasticity
of the lumber is destroyed. The results of kiln-drying
depend largely upon the kiln, and upon the skill
with which the lumber is piled, the heat applied, and the
rapidity of evaporation of the moisture regulated.</p>

<p>For these reasons, much kiln-dried lumber is suitable
for use where but little strength is required and where
the color and the grain are the important points to
consider.</p>

<p><b>19. Moist air kilns.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) There are two types of
dry kilns in common use: the <i>natural draft</i>, or moist air,
kilns, and the <i>induced draft</i> kilns. These two types are
made by different manufacturers, nearly all of whom use
certain devices of which they control the patents, and
which constitute the chief difference between their kiln
and those made by other manufacturers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The moist air kilns are so constructed as to
allow the freest possible circulation of the heated air,
and to provide opportunities for the moisture to be
expelled in accordance with certain natural laws, which
results are obtained by a carefully planned and managed
system of ventilation. These kilns operate upon the
principle that heated air circulating naturally through
lumber will become charged to a much greater degree with
moisture than if it were forced through rapidly, as in the
induced draft kilns. Thus, heated air by passing slowly
through a pile of lumber may become charged with moisture
nearly to the dew point.</p>

<p>If the humidity of the heated air is maintained at that
point, by allowing the moisture to pass out as it accumulates,
with a small amount of heated air, which is
replaced with fresh air from the outside, it is claimed that
the boards will dry out from their centers. (<b>C.</b>) As the
warm, moist air which circulates through the pile will
keep the outsides of the boards moist, it will prevent case
hardening, or the hardening of the outsides of the boards.
This is caused by very warm dry air, which “cooks,”
or closes the pores of the surface of the boards, and this
prevents the outsides from shrinking, while the insides
will be so badly checked and discolored as to destroy the
boards.</p>

<p>After the moisture is all out of the lumber, that held in
suspension will gradually pass out of the kiln, and the air
inside will become perfectly dry.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) It is claimed that all kinds of lumber in common
use may be put into this type of kiln perfectly
green, except oak and other very hard woods, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
should have at least thirty days’ drying under good drying
conditions for each inch in thickness. It is also claimed
that the moist air kiln is simply weather drying accelerated,—the
moisture being thoroughly extracted from the
lumber, the result being the same as though it were stacked
out of doors for several years,—and that the lumber has
lost none of its strength, elasticity, or characteristic color.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) This method sometimes is applied by steam pipes
extending between each course of boards, and in this
way the lumber is dried out very rapidly. Lumber used
in this sort of kiln should be thoroughly weather-dried, or
otherwise the high temperature will cause it to check
badly. In certain forms of these kilns, the lumber is
saturated with live steam after it is piled in the kiln, before
the heat is turned on.</p>

<p><b>20. Induced draft kilns.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) This system of kiln-drying
consists of a power-driven fan, which forces the
heated air at a high rate of speed through the spaces between
and around the lumber piled in the chamber.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Manufacturers have different devices for extracting
the moisture from the air after it has passed through
the lumber piles. It may be passed over condensing plates,
or through coils of pipes in which cold water is continually
circulating, both of these devices being for the purpose of
extracting the moisture from the heated air. If the
moisture is separated from the air by condensation, it runs
away, but if not, a certain per cent of the heated air is
expelled out of doors, being replaced by fresh air. The
air in the kiln, somewhat cooled from contact with these
cooled surfaces, is returned to the heater, reheated, and
again forced through the kiln, which operation is repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
continuously and automatically. Thus the heated air
becomes charged with a small percentage of moisture each
time it passes through the kiln chamber; this moisture is
extracted and the air is again heated before beginning
another circuit, instead of slow circulation which allows
the heated air to become saturated with moisture before
it is discharged, as in the moist air kiln.</p>

<p>The induced draft dry kiln requires quite an expensive
equipment, as the blower and the appliance which drive
it are necessary in addition to the equipment of the kiln
itself, which would be similar in either of the types of kiln
described. Lumber to be dried in this form of kiln must
be well weather-dried before it is exposed to the high
temperature of the kiln.</p>

<p><b>21. Results of the two systems.</b>—While it is not the
province of this book to pass judgment upon the results
of the different methods or forms of dry kilns, it is obvious
that the induced draft kiln is the more expensive to operate,
as the expense of running the blower is avoided in
the moist air system. In this latter type of kiln the steam
simply passes through the pipes, the condensation being
returned to the boiler to be reheated, so the only expense
is that of maintaining the fire to keep up a low pressure.
In the daytime, or while the engine which furnishes the
power for the plant is running, the kilns of either type may
be heated by exhaust steam.</p>

<p>Many users of one or both systems seem satisfied with
the results obtained from either, while others are decided
in their preference.</p>

<p><b>22. Filling a kiln.</b>—In doing this, care should be
used that there is plenty of room for the air to circulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
freely around and through the pile—not less than 3”
between the edges of the boards horizontally and vertically,
and one foot between the lumber and the wall or adjacent pile.
Each course of boards should be so planned as to bring the
same width over those of the course below, if possible, in
order to keep a vertical air space through the pile. In
some cases the kiln is filled by placing the boards edgeways.</p>

<p><b>23. Length of time lumber should be left in the kiln.</b>—No
one should undertake to operate a kiln unless he
understands perfectly the particular make of the kiln that
he is handling, for if the ventilation is not correctly regulated,
the entire charge of the kiln may become mildewed,
casehardened, checked, discolored, or dried unevenly.
No rule can be given for the time which lumber should be
left in the kiln, as it depends upon the condition of the
lumber, temperature, kind of lumber, dimensions, and
ventilation. Generally speaking, if the kiln is properly
constructed and operated, from two to four days for
each inch in thickness of soft wood, and from two to
three times as long, at a lower temperature, for hard
wood, is usually enough to extract the moisture. It is,
however, best to allow the lumber to stay in the kiln, at
a moderate temperature, from three days to two weeks
after the moisture is extracted, in order to harden and
cook the solids of the sap, as by so doing the lumber is
not so liable to be influenced by moisture in the future;
this is the effect that long weather-drying accomplishes.</p>

<p><b>24. The care of kiln-dried lumber.</b>—It is a common
mistake to allow lumber to lie in an open shed or other
place where it will absorb moisture from the atmosphere,
and still call it kiln-dried. Lumber of this sort should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
be kept in a place where heat can be applied in damp
weather, and should be stacked in a close, compact pile,
so as to prevent the air from coming in contact with it.</p>

<p><b>25. Steaming wood.</b>—This process makes wood pliable,
and adds to its durability by destroying the germs which
may cause decay; it also neutralizes, to a great extent,
the effect of the presence of sap. Steaming or immersing
wood in boiling water minimizes its tendency to shrink
and swell, and wood thus treated is not so apt to check
in seasoning. Steamed wood loses some of its original
strength on account of the effect of the high temperature
upon the fibers.</p>

<p><b>26. Preserving wood.</b>—In order to preserve wood, it
is sometimes treated with creosote or other chemicals,
which are forced into the wood at a sufficient pressure to
cause them to permeate the wood thoroughly. This
treatment enables the wood to resist better the elements
and to keep away insects, which do a great deal of damage,
frequently honeycombing the wood with holes, with little
or no evidence of their presence upon the outside.</p>

<p class="c large"><span class="smcap">Tools</span></p>


<p><b>27. How to purchase tools.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) The quality of the
tools used by the mechanic is of the greatest importance.
They should be selected carefully, and while it is the
poorest economy to buy anything but the best, the best
are not necessarily the most finely finished.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In purchasing tools, it is well to remember that
those made especially for some dealer, and bearing his
name, if sold for a less price than the best, are usually not
of the highest grade, and should be shunned. It is wisest
to buy standard makes, examining them carefully to be
sure that there are no visible defects. The temper of
steel may be discovered only by use, and any defects in
the best grades of tools is made good upon complaint to
the dealer.</p>

<p><b>28. Benches.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Figure 25 shows the type of bench
used in the most up-to-date carpenter and cabinet shops,
while that used by carpenters for ordinary work usually is
of the type shown in Fig. 26.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In many manual-training schools, the benches are
of the former type, and in the most completely equipped
schools, are fitted with locked drawers and closets for the
reception of tools, not only to keep the latter in condition
for use, but to insure that the set of tools is complete, and
to be able to place the responsibility for damage or loss.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The <i>vises</i> should be of the modern, quick action
design, which, on account of the rapidity with which they
work, are superseding the old-fashioned wooden and iron
screw vises.</p>

</div>

<p><b>29. Rules.</b>—The two-foot, four-fold <i>rule</i> (Fig. 27) is
the one generally used by carpenters. It is made of different
grades, the more expensive makes
being divided into 16ths, 8ths, 10ths, and
12ths, and having the ⅛“, ¼”, ⅜“, ½”, ¾“,
1”, 1½“, and 3” scales upon them.
Although the cheaper rule is just as accurate,
it is divided usually into 8ths and
16ths only. The form of rule shown in
Fig. 28 is becoming quite popular, as it
is longer. Since rules are easily lost or
broken, many workmen have a good rule
for scaling, and a cheaper one for general
work.</p>

<p><b>30. The try-square</b> (<b>A.</b>) consists of the
beam (Fig. 29, <i>a</i>), which is generally of metal-lined
wood, and the blade (<i>b</i>), which is a thin piece of steel.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Too much care cannot be exercised in the selection
of this tool, as one which is not perfectly true may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>cause much trouble. To test a square, hold the beam
against a perfectly straight and square edge of a board
which is wide enough to allow a knife line to be made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
entire length of the blade. Then turn the square over,
the other side up, and, holding the beam against the same
edge, move the blade to the line. If the jointed edge
of the board and the square are perfectly accurate, the
knife line and the edge of the board will perfectly coincide.</p>

</div>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The use of this
tool in squaring an
edge is shown in Fig.
29. The piece being
squared should be in
such a position that
the try-square will be
between the eye and
the light; in this way,
the slightest inaccuracy
may be detected.
In Fig. 31 is shown
the position of the
try-square when used
to make a line by the
edge of the blade.
If working from the
edge indicated, hold
the beam against the edge with the thumb, and at the
same time hold the blade down with one or two fingers,
using the others to steady the square in its place upon
the board. (<b>D.</b>) Two try-squares may be used to see if
a piece of wood is “out of wind” (<i>i</i> sounded as in kind)
by the method indicated in Fig. 30.</p>

<p>Two pieces of wood known as <i>winding sticks</i>, of exactly
the same width and perfectly parallel, are often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
used in manual-training schools for this purpose; they
are rarely used in a shop, however, as a workman generally
will use two steel squares if the piece is too large
to be sighted accurately without some aid of this sort.</p>

<p><b>31. The steel, or framing, square</b> (Fig. 32) is often
used as a try-square upon large work, though its most important
use is in framing, or roof construction. It is indispensable
in finding the lengths and the angles of rafters,
braces, etc. Its use for this
purpose will be explained
in “Constructive Carpentry.”
The long side of the

the “blade,” and the short

<p><b>33. The gauge</b> (<b>A.</b>), Fig. 34, is for the purpose of making
lines parallel to the face or working side or edge.
Usually it is made in four
pieces: the “head” (<i>a</i>),
which is held against the face
side or edge; the “stick”
(<i>bb</i>), upon which the head
moves; the “thumbscrew”
(<i>c</i>), which holds the head
firmly in its position upon
the stick; and the “point”
(<i>d</i>), which makes the desired
mark upon the wood.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f34">

<p class="caption"><i>a</i>, the head; <i>bb</i>, the stick; <i>c</i>,<br /> the thumbscrew;
<i>d</i>, the point.</p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) A rule should be used in setting the gauge, unless
one is certain that the point is located accurately with
regard to the graduations upon the stick.</p>

<p>The point should be sharpened to work with either a
push or pull cut, as at <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The gauge should be grasped as shown in Fig. 35,
and generally used with a push, though it is occasionally
pulled toward the worker. One should always work from
the face side of the piece.</p>

<p>If the point enters the wood too deeply, it may be set
back, or the gauge carried on the corner of the stick as indicated,
which will govern the depth of the cut. Do not use
a dull gauge, or one with a round point like a pencil, as it
will tear the wood, instead of making a clean cut or scratch.</p>

<p><b>34. The hammer</b> (<b>A.</b>) is used by the average wood-worker
more than any other tool. The “face” (Fig.
36, <i>a</i>) and the “claws” (<i>b</i>) should be tempered carefully,
as they will either bruise or bend if too soft, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
break if too hard. The eye (<i>c</i>) is made longer than it is
wide, to prevent the head from turning on the handle,
and larger at the outside of the head than it is at the neck,
so that the handle may be firmly wedged in the eye or
socket. The neck (<i>d</i>), by extending upon the handle as it
does, adds much to the strength of the connection.</p>

in a flat surface without the knuckles striking, which
means that the center of the handle should be about parallel
with the flat surface. A line lengthwise of the head
through the eye should exactly coincide with the long, or
major, axis of the ellipse at the end of the handle, as at <i>gg</i>,
or pounded fingers will result.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>bell-faced</i> hammer is to be preferred to the <i>flat-faced</i>
type, as it will not mar the wood so badly if the nail is
missed, though more skill is required to use it. Upon rough
work, the bell-faced hammer will sink the nail beneath the
surface without bruising the wood badly. Upon inside work,
the nails should be sunk beneath the surface with a nail set.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In nailing, the young workman should acquire the
habit of grasping the handle of the hammer at the end,
as this will give greater force to the
blow. Upon light work, the hand
will naturally slip a little toward
the head. Nails should generally
be driven in a slanting direction,
as they hold better than if driven
straight. When nails are driven as
shown at <i>a</i>, Fig. 37, it is called
“toenailing,” and when driven sufficiently
to hold, but not driven home,
as at <i>b</i>, they are said to be “tacked.” Nails are driven
this way when they are to be pulled out again, as in stay
laths, and in fastening pieces temporarily.</p>

<p>In forcing matched boards together, do not pound
directly upon the tongue edge of the board, but upon a
waste piece of the same material, as the tongue will be
bruised so that the
next board will not
form a good joint.
Care should be used
that the hammer
does not strike the
edge of the board
when the nail is
driven home. To
guard against this, a
nail set should be
used to sink the
head beneath the surface,
as in Fig. 38, so
that the next board
will come to its place
without trouble.
This is called “blind
nailing.”</p>

(<b>A.</b>) is used for hewing
light work, for shingling; and as a heavy hammer,
though the face is rarely tempered to stand very heavy
usage (Fig. 39, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) A <i>hand axe</i>, or broad hatchet (Fig. 39, <i>b</i>), usually
is a better grade of tool than the hatchet, and as it is of
greater weight, is better adapted for heavy work. A
hatchet or hand axe for general use should be sharpened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>

<p><b>36. The mallet.</b>—This tool should be used upon chisel
handles, as a hammer
will destroy the handle
in a very short time.
Mallets are of two
shapes, the <i>square-faced</i>
(Fig. 40, <i>a</i>) and the
<i>round</i> mallet (<i>b</i>), the
latter being preferred
by many workmen as it
will always strike a fair blow upon the chisel handle, while
the square-faced mallet sometimes will miss, and inflict a
painful blow upon the hand. In general, the handle of
a square-faced mallet is round,
which allows the mallet to turn
in the hand; if the handle were
made elliptical, like a hammer
handle, there would be less
likelihood of missing the chisel.</p>

<p><b>37. Saws.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) The saws
used by the carpenter are for
cutting parallel with, or across,
the grain, or a combination of
the two, and all are composed
of two parts, the “handle” and the “blade.”</p>

<p>The teeth of a <i>ripsaw</i> (Fig. 41, <i>A</i>) are suitable for sawing
in a direction parallel with the general direction of the
grain. The points of different saws may be from one
third to one seventh of an inch apart, and form a series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
chisels, the cutting edges of which are filed so that they
are at right angles to the sides of the blade. In action,
the saw is pushed against the wood, each tooth cutting
a little deeper than
the one preceding it.</p>

<p>The <i>cutting-off
saw</i> (Fig. 41, <i>B</i>) has
from six to twelve
knife-pointed teeth
to an inch, the cutting
edges being
parallel to the sides
of the blade, and
filed so that the
point of the tooth
is upon the side
which is set beyond
the side of the blade.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.—Saws.</span><br />
(In each of the three varieties of saw teeth shown in<br />
Fig. 41, the set of the teeth is exaggerated.)</p>
</div>

<p>In all except the
finest saws, the
teeth are set; that
is, the points are
bent a very little in
such a way as to
make the cut wider
than the thickness
of the blade, so that
the saw may cut
through the wood
without binding,
which it could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
do if the cut were the same thickness as the blade. The
blades of all high grade saws are thinner upon the back than
upon the cutting edge, but if the saw is to be used upon the
finest work, this difference in the thickness of the two edges
of the blade is supposed to make the setting of the saw unnecessary.
For general work, it will be found that the saw
will be much more efficient if it is given a set adapted to
the size of the teeth, or to the nature of the work it is expected
to do.</p>

<p>The <i>compass</i>, or <i>keyhole</i>, <i>saw</i> (Fig. 41, <i>C</i>) is used where
it is necessary that the saw should cut both with and across
the grain. It is used to start the cut for a rip- or cutting-off
saw, when a cut has to be made in the surface of a
board. This saw is used also in many places where it is
not practicable to use a larger saw, and for sawing curves.
In order to allow it to cut around curves easily, the face, or
cutting edge, is considerably thicker than the back, and
the blade is made of soft metal. It may then be given
a heavy set, so that it will bend instead of breaking or
kinking, as it would be liable to do from the nature of its
work if made of tempered steel.</p>

<p>Some carpenters working upon job work, where it is
desirable to carry as few tools as possible, have a narrow
20” or 22” saw sharpened like
a compass saw, which for
ordinary work is quite satisfactory
as either a cutting-off
or a ripsaw, thus making
another saw unnecessary.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f42">
<img src="images/fig42.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.—Backsaw.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>backsaw</i> (Fig. 42) is used upon fine work; it is
filed like a cutting-off saw, but the teeth have rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
more hook, and it often has as many as fifteen teeth to the
inch, though a twelve-tooth saw is as fine as is generally
used. The thick back is to stiffen the blade of the saw,
and if the latter becomes sprung, a light blow upon the
back, as though to drive it upon the blade, will usually
straighten it.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In buying a saw, select one which is thicker upon
the cutting edge than upon the back; this allows the saw
to be used upon very fine work with little or no setting.
See that the handle fits the hand, and that the saw hangs to
suit, or “feels right.” This is a matter concerning the
balance and the weight of the tool, which cannot be described,
but which any one accustomed to using tools will
miss if a tool not possessing this quality is placed in his hand.</p>

<p>A saw blade, unless very short and thick, should bend
so that the point may be put through the handle, and
upon being released, instantly resume its shape. It should
bend evenly in proportion to the width and the gauge of
the saw, and should be as thin as the stiffness of the blade
will permit, as a saw of this sort cuts less wood, and therefore
runs with less resistance. A compass saw, being
softer, is not expected to stand the above test.</p>

<p>A 26” or a 28” blade is best for a heavy rip or cutting-off
saw to be used upon coarse work; but for fine work,
a 22” blade, commonly known as a “panel saw,” is a convenient
size, though a 20” or a 24” blade is preferred by
many workmen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f43">
<img src="images/fig43.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 43.—Use of the Saw.</span></p>
<p class="caption">Showing the method of using a try-square to insure accuracy.</p>
</div>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) A hard saw is best for fine work, but for general work
most workmen prefer a saw of medium hardness, as the
teeth of a hard saw are apt to break in setting, and its
edge, if it comes in contact with metal, requires filing just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
about as quickly
as that of a soft
saw, and is much
more difficult to
sharpen. If always
filed by an expert
filer, a hard saw is
superior in every
way to any other.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f44">
<img src="images/fig44.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.—Reset Saw<br />
Handle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) The handle
of the saw should
be grasped firmly
by three fingers,
as in Fig. 43, with
the forefinger extended
along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
side, thus making more room for the three fingers, and
giving better control of the saw. Very little strength
should be used in forcing a fine saw
to cut, as its own weight generally is
sufficient; if the saw is forced, it will
not run smoothly, but will bind, and
if a thin board is being worked, it is
apt to split. The saw should be used
from the face side of the material, so
that any splinters or variation will be upon the back side
and out of sight.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) It is the custom of some carpenters to reset the
handles of their heavy saws by drilling holes through the
blade so that the handle may be fastened as close to
the cutting edge as possible, as in Fig. 44. This brings the
force of the stroke nearer the direct line of the cut, which
obviously allows a more economical application of force.
Never leave a saw in a cut, for if the piece of wood falls off
the trestles, the saw is apt to be broken. (Saw-filing will
be discussed later.)</p>

<p><b>38. The knife blade</b> used by the wood-worker for general
work is similar to that shown in
Fig. 45, at <i>A</i>. That shown at <i>B</i> is the
form of blade in most common use in

the knife from following the grain.</p>

<p><b>39. Planes.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) The <i>plane</i> is the
most complex, as well as one of the most important,
tools which the wood-worker uses, and a high grade of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
skill is necessary to keep it in order, as well as to use it
properly.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The only plane in use until recent years had a
wooden stock, and the iron was adjusted by blows with
a hammer; this form of plane has changed very little
since the first types were invented, as planes of ancient
times have been found which in all essentials are practically
the same as those in use to-day.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Our modern planes are more easily adjusted and
more convenient to use, though they will do no better
work than the wooden planes of our forefathers, which are
still preferred by many of the best workmen. The face of
an iron plane holds its shape permanently, while it is necessary
that the wooden plane should be jointed occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" id="f47">
<img src="images/fig47.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.—Result of Using Plane<br />
with Improperly Adjusted Cap
Iron.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) There are planes for every conceivable purpose,
all constructed upon the same general principle as the
common bench plane which
we shall discuss later. These
planes are adjusted by screws
and levers, which are very
simple, and any one understanding
them may easily comprehend
the more intricate
molding or universal planes.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the
modern plane may be understood
by a careful study of Fig. 46 and by comparing
it with the plane itself. The “cutter,” “iron,” or “bit”
(1) and the “cap iron” (2) are the essentials of the tool, and
it is upon their condition and adjustment that the efficiency
of the plane depends. If the cap iron is set too
far from the edge of the iron, and if the cut is made against
the grain, the shaving will not break before it leads the
iron into the wood, as shown in
Fig. 47. If the cap iron is set
somewhat less than ¹⁄₁₆” from
the edge of the cutter, according
to the wood being planed,
it will break the shaving nearly
as soon as it is cut, as in Fig. 48,
and will result in a smooth, clean
surface. The closer the cap iron
is set to the edge, the smoother
the iron will cut, as the breaks in the shaving are thereby
made shorter.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f48">
<img src="images/fig48.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.—Result of Using<br />
Plane with Cap Iron Adjusted
Properly.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>It will be seen that the closer the bottom of the cap iron
(2) is set to the edge of the cutter (1), the shorter the
breaks will be, as in Fig. 48, and the more smoothly the
plane will cut. The plane “iron screw” (3) holds the edge of
the cutter (1) and the bottom of the cap iron (2) in their
desired relation. The “cap lever” (4) being pressed against
the under side of the head of the “cap screw” (5), by the
“cam” (4<i>a</i>), holds the iron in its place, and presses the
cap iron (2) firmly against the top of the cutter (1). Unless
the cap iron fits the face of the cutter perfectly, the
plane will not work satisfactorily. The “frog” (6)
carries all the adjusting mechanism of the plane, and may
be moved backward or forward to reduce or enlarge the
“mouth” (6<i>a</i>), which should be no larger than is necessary
to allow the shavings to pass freely. The frog
rarely will require readjusting after it has been properly
located.</p>

<p>The “Y lever” (7) forces the plane irons (1 and 2)
in or out simultaneously, which governs the projection,
or “set,” of the edge of the cutter (1) beyond the face, or
“sole” (<i>b</i>) of the “plane stock,” and thus the thickness
of the shaving which the plane will cut. The “adjusting
nut” (8) moves freely upon the “screw” (8<i>a</i>) and operates
the Y lever (7). The “lateral adjustment” (9) is for
the purpose of forcing the iron to cut in the exact center of
the width of the face (b) of the plane. The two “frog
screws” (10) hold the frog rigidly in the position which
will make the throat (6<i>a</i>) of the desired size.</p>

<p>The above illustrates all the adjusting mechanism; the
other parts of the plane are as follows: “handle” (11);
“knob” (12); “handle bolt” and “nut” (13); “knob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
bolt” and “nut” (14); “handle screw” (15); “bottom,”
or “stock” (16).</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f49">
<img src="images/fig49.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.—Setting a Plane.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The face, or sole, of the plane (<i>b</i>) must be perfectly
straight, or good work cannot be done. The ends of the
plane (<i>h</i> and <i>t</i>) are
called the “heel” and
“toe,” respectively.
The “mouth” of the
plane (between 6<i>a</i>
and 2) must be kept
clear of shavings,
or it may become
clogged.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) In setting a
plane, do not pass
the fingers over the
face, or sole, as cut
fingers may result.
Hold the plane as
shown in Fig. 49,
and look toward the
light, when the exact
projection of the cutter may be seen. Notice the position
of the fingers of the left hand, and that the eye glances
from toe to heel. This leaves the right hand free to make
the adjustments. This is a workmanlike way of setting a
plane, and in this, as in all handling of tools, awkwardness
should be avoided.</p>

<p><b>40. Sharpening a plane.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) An important part of
this process is <i>the grinding of the cutter</i>. Set the cap
back about ⅛” from the edge of the iron, and use it as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
guide by which to grind the iron perfectly square, as at
<i>A</i>, Fig. 50. The cap iron should be kept perfectly square,
and never touched except to fit it to the cutter, or, if it is
too thick to allow the shavings to pass freely, to file the
top of it to the proper thickness. If the tool is kept in
order skillfully, the cap
will need care only upon
rare occasions.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f50">
<img src="images/fig50.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.—Whetting and Grinding of<br />
Plane.</span></p>
<p class="caption">(For explanation, see text.)</p>
</div>

<p>The cutter should be
held firmly to the grindstone
or emery wheel
and kept moving from
side to side to prevent
wearing the stone in
one place. The grinding
should all be done
upon the beveled side of
the cutter, which should be held upon the stone at an
angle of about 20° (as at <i>B</i>, Fig. 50), more rather than
less, as a thinner edge is apt to “chatter,” or vibrate, if
it strikes a hard place in the wood. Many workmen use
a rest when grinding; this insures a true bevel. Any
device which holds the tool firmly at the same place on
the stone will do for a rest.</p>

<p>In whetting the cutter, the screw of the cap iron should
be loosened and the cap iron carried back until the screw
stops at the top of the slot of the bit, as at <i>C</i>, Fig. 50.
The screw is then tightened with the fingers to hold the
cap in place; this gives a better grasp of the iron, though
some workmen prefer to take the cap off entirely while
whetting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f51">
<img src="images/fig51.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.—Whetting or Oilstoning the Beveled Side of a Cutter.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The bevel of the iron should be held exactly upon the
surface of the oilstone, as shown at <i>C</i>, Fig. 50, the iron
being grasped as in Fig. 51. Keep the right wrist rigid
and allow the arm to swing from the shoulder, bending
only at the elbow. In this way the rocking motion may
be reduced to a minimum; this is necessary to preserve
the bevel. Though the bevel may be maintained better
by imparting a short circular motion to the plane iron, or
to any edge tool which is being sharpened, it seems an awkward
and fussy method of work, and rarely is used by an
expert workman. By long practice the mechanic finds
that a stroke made nearly the entire length of the stone
will impart an edge quicker, and after the knack has been
acquired, the bevel will be preserved just as well.</p>

<p>Turn the whetstone end for end frequently, and work
upon the farther end, as in this way the stone may be
kept true much longer than if one place upon it is used all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the time. This will also minimize the danger of pulling
the tool off from the nearer end of the stone, which will
generally make regrinding necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f52">
<img src="images/fig52.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.—Whetting or Oilstoning the Plain Side of the Plane Iron.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When the beveled side has been whetted, lay the face,
or the top of the iron, perfectly flat upon the stone, as in
Fig. 52, holding it down with the fingers of the left hand,
using the right hand only to move the iron back and forth.
Care should be used that under no circumstances is the
face of the iron lifted the slightest degree from the stone.
At this stage of sharpening a plane iron, the utmost care
is necessary that the face of the cutter does not lose its
perfectly straight surface at the edge, as the slightest
deviation from absolute accuracy at this place will prevent
the cap iron from fitting properly, which will cause endless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
trouble, as the shavings will be forced between the
cap and the face of the iron (see <b>C.</b> of this topic).</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f53">
<img src="images/fig53.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.—Shape<br />
of Edge of<br />
Plane Iron.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The shape of the cutting edge of the plane cutter
has an important influence upon its efficiency. Imagine
the edge divided into three equal parts: the middle part
should be perfectly straight, or almost imperceptibly
rounded; the two outside thirds
should be slightly and gradually rounded
until the corners of the iron are so short that
there will be no danger of their projecting
below the face of the plane. This gives
the edge an elliptical shape, as shown in
Fig. 53, which is somewhat exaggerated, as the shape
shown is about that which would be seen if a moderately
coarse jack plane were held as in Fig. 49.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) In order to insure fine work, the cap iron must be
fitted so carefully to the face and the edge of the cutter
that, if necessary, it may be placed less than ¹⁄₆₄th of an inch
from the cutting edge, though this would rarely be required
except upon very cross-grained wood.</p>

<p>In fitting the cap iron to the top of the cutter, a very
fine, sharp file should be used. The filing must all be
done upon the under side of the cap iron, at the places
where it rests upon the face or top of the cutter; or, if
preferred, the cap may be very carefully bent, but unless
there is considerable fitting necessary, and unless the joint
is perfected by the use of a file, this method is not
recommended.</p>

<p>If sufficient care and skill are exercised, a plane may be
sharpened and adjusted so finely that a veneer of .01”
or less in thickness of bird’s-eye maple, burl walnut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
ash, or similar wood may be smoothed. It is not wise,
however, to spend the time necessary to keep a plane
sharpened and adjusted to do this sort of work, as a
scraper and sandpaper, or the latter alone, is the most
economical way to smooth woods of such nature.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) To remedy clogging of the mouth, remove the conditions
which cause it; simply digging out the shavings
is useless. An improperly fitted cap iron is one of the
principal causes of trouble; the cutter may be ground so
thin that when it is forced against a knot or hard place,
the iron chatters, which allows the shavings an entrance
under the cap iron. In this lies the only real advantage
of a wooden plane over the modern iron plane, as in
the former the iron is much thicker and stiffer. The
cap iron may be so thick that it causes the shavings to
curl too much, or the frog may be set too far to the
front, which will make the mouth too small. This latter
may be remedied by moving the frog back, but in a
wooden plane, the mouth and the throat would have to
be cut larger in order to allow the shavings to clear themselves
properly.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.—Jack Plane.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>41. The jack plane</b> (Fig. 54) generally is 15” long,
and its ordinary use is for the purpose of roughing out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
piece of wood for jointing or smoothing. If it is properly
sharpened, it may be used as a smoothing plane, or as a
jointer upon small work, as it is capable of doing as good
work as any plane.</p>

<p>The jack plane generally is ground more rounding, and
the cap set farther back than in the other planes, especially
if it is to be used upon rough work.</p>

<p><b>42. The jointer.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) This tool is from 20” to 26”
long, and is used to straighten edges and surfaces, or to
fit them together. The shape of the edge of the cutter
of this plane should be but slightly elliptical, less so than
the jack plane or the smoother, unless the two latter are
fitted for doing very fine work.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In using a jointer for squaring or jointing an edge,
it should be carried to one side or the other of its face as
may be necessary to take advantage of the elliptically
shaped edge of the cutter, by cutting a shaving thicker on
one edge than on the other, thus making the edge of the
board square with the face side.</p>

<p>To make a perfectly square edge, the cut should be
made in the center of both the iron and the width of the
face of the plane. The plane should be held as shown
in Fig. 55, the fingers under the face of the plane, the
tops of the finger-nails touching the board lightly, guiding
the plane, and keeping the bit cutting in one place
upon its edge.</p>

<img src="images/fig55.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.—Method of Guiding a Jointer.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>43. The smoothing plane</b> (<b>A.</b>) is of the same type and
mechanism as those described above, though it is but
9 or 10” long; if satisfactory work is expected from it,
it must be kept in good order, with the cap iron perfectly
fitted. For general work, it is not necessary to spend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
time to insure that the plane should be continually in
readiness to work upon hard, tough, cross-grained wood,
as a plane to do the latter kind of work well is unnecessary
upon softer or straight-grained wood. For ordinary
work, the cap iron should be set from ¹⁄₃₂” to ¹⁄₁₆” from the
edge of the bit, but for the finest work, the closer to the
edge it will fit and allow a shaving to be taken, the finer
the work that may be done. No wood used upon ordinary
work is so cross-grained or knurly that it cannot be
smoothed economically, if a properly sharpened and adjusted
plane is used.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.—Knuckle Joint Block Plane.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) A smoothing plane should cut a shaving as nearly
the entire width of the bit as possible, therefore a very flat,
elliptically shaped edge must be maintained. In using a
plane or any kind of
cutting tool, the direction
of the grain
of the wood should
be carefully studied,
and every advantage
taken of it to facilitate
the work.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f57">
<img src="images/fig57.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.—Use of the Block Plane.</span></p>
<p class="caption">(For explanation, see text.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>44. The block
plane</b> (knuckle joint
cap, Fig. 56) (<b>A.</b>) is constructed upon a somewhat different
principle than the planes above described, as the adjusting
nut (<i>a</i>) under the cutter at the rear end of the plane is
raised or lowered to withdraw
or advance the bit,
and thus govern the cut of
the tool. The size of the
mouth is controlled by a
movable section of the face
at <i>b</i>. This plane has no
cap iron, as the use for
which it is intended makes
it unnecessary. The block
plane is used across the
end of the wood, at right
angles with the general direction of the grain. The iron,
or cutter, is so placed in the stock of the plane that its
cutting angle is as nearly in line with the cut as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
with the beveled side of the iron uppermost. By this
method of construction, the iron is given more stiffness to
resist the chatter, or vibration, caused by planing end wood.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f58">
<img src="images/fig58.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.—Using Block Plane upon Small<br />
Pieces.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In using the block plane, do not make the cuts
from edge to edge,
or chips will be
broken off at the corners;
instead, plane
from each edge, and
stop the stroke before
the other edge
is reached; reverse
the plane and work
from the other direction,
as shown at <i>A</i>,
<i>B</i>, Fig. 57. Another
and workmanlike
way of using
the block plane upon
small pieces is shown
in Fig. 58. Work
from each edge as described
above, turning
the piece over
for each stroke. In sharpening the block plane iron,
the edge should be made slightly elliptical, and the bevel
carefully maintained.</p>

<p><b>45. The correct position.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) In using planes or
any edge tools, a position should be taken which will
furnish sufficient resistance to the pressure required for
making the cut, as the pressure should be applied firmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and steadily. With experience, the correct position will
be taken involuntarily, but the beginner should be continually
upon the watch to overcome his awkwardness.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The habit of bending from the hips is acquired
easily, and the young workman should learn to work in as
nearly an erect position as possible, for if the bending of
the shoulders is persisted in, a permanent stoop will result.
Stand facing the work and clear of the bench in
order to prevent unnecessary wear of the clothing.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f59">
<img src="images/fig59.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.—Incorrect Use of Jack
Plane.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Do not allow the
plane to drop over the
end of the board at either
the beginning or the end
of the stroke, as indicated
at <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, Fig. 59. To prevent
this, the hand should be kept upon that part of
the plane which is upon the board; at the beginning of
the stroke, the weight should be upon the front end of the
plane, as in Fig. 60, and at the end of the stroke upon the
rear end, or upon the handle, as in Fig. 61. Begin and end
each stroke with a lifting motion instead of allowing the
plane to drop as it leaves or enters the wood. The plane
should be held firmly, not rigidly; do not allow it to jump;
this is caused generally by an attempt to take a shaving
heavier than the plane should cut, or, if the cap iron is
fitted and adjusted properly, by a dull iron. A cutter will
jump or chatter if it does not fit solidly against the frog.
In drawing the plane back after making a stroke, carry it
upon the toe, or upon one corner; do not drag it flat
upon its face, as the iron is thereby dulled as much as
when it is cutting, or possibly more.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Carry the plane parallel with the grain when it is
possible, and take no more shavings off than is necessary
to attain the desired results. The young workman should
make a study of the grain and the peculiarities of the
different kinds of lumber upon which he works, losing no
opportunity to experiment upon and compare the qualities
of every available wood.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) In using edge tools of every kind, little is gained,
and much is often lost, by working with dull tools; tools
should be sharpened often and thoroughly. This is of the
utmost importance, for even with the tools in the best
possible order, it will require much care and skill to do
good work.</p>

<p><b>46. Chisels.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Carpenters’ chisels are used for
paring and mortising; the paring chisel should be light,
smoothly finished, and ground with a sharper bevel than
that used for mortising, for which the heaviest chisel is
none too strong.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Chisels are “tanged” or “socket,” according
to the method by which the blade and handle is joined.
The tanged firmer chisel (Fig. 62, <i>A</i>) is the older form, and
is not so strong as the more recently designed socket chisel
(<i>B</i>). For light work, the tanged chisel is preferred by
many, but more commonly the socket chisel is used, as it
is stiffer, not so easily broken, and has no shoulder to
catch upon the edge of the wood when the tool is used.
The beveled-edge chisel (<i>C</i>) is a favorite tool with pattern
makers; and the mortise, or framing chisel (<i>D</i>), is designed
for heavy use. A set of chisels consists of one each
of the following dimensions: ⅛”, ¼”, ⅜”, ½”, ⅝”, ¾”, ⅞”,
1”, 1¼”, 1½”, 1¾”, 2”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) A large, heavy chisel, 3½” or 4” in width, called
a “slice” or “slick,” is used, like a paring chisel, upon
heavy work.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f62">
<img src="images/fig62.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.—Chisels.</span></p>
<p class="caption"><i>A</i>, tanged firmer chisel; <i>B</i>, socket<br />
chisel; <i>C</i>, beveled-edge chisel; <i>D</i>,<br />
mortise, or framing chisel.</p>
</div>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Handles for paring chisels may be of any hard
wood and of any convenient shape, as these should not be
pounded upon. Although they
are occasionally used for cutting
small mortises, it is not a good
practice unless the tops of the
handles are protected by leather
or fiber tops. Mortising chisels
should have handles of the toughest
wood obtainable, preferably
hickory, with leather nailed with
small brads upon the top to protect
the wood. If a leather
washer is fastened to the handle
by a pin or dowel, the wood will
in time pound down and the
leather be broken out and destroyed,
while if braided upon
the handle, the leather may be renewed as often as necessary.
An iron ring, or ferrule, is used by many to prevent
the handle from splitting, but this will bruise the face of the
mallet. A hammer should never be used upon any sort
of wooden handle, or the handle will be very quickly destroyed,
but a mallet will injure it comparatively little.
In fitting the handle to the chisel blade, care should be
used that they are in perfect alignment, as otherwise a
sharp blow may break the blade.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) In sharpening a mortise chisel, it should be ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
at an angle of not less than 30°, as a thinner edge would be
apt to break upon coming in contact with a knot. A
paring chisel may be ground as
thin as 20°, as it does not have
to stand heavy blows, and a better
edge for the purpose may
thus be obtained. In whetting a
chisel, the bevel must be carefully
maintained, and the back kept perfectly straight,
like the face of a plane iron, or it will be impossible to
work to a line.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f63">
<img src="images/fig63.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.—Drawshave.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>47. Gouges</b> may in general be described in the same way
as chisels, except that they are curved instead of flat.
The terms “inside” and “outside,” used in describing
them, indicate whether they are ground upon the inside
or the outside of the curve.</p>

<p><b>48. The drawshave</b> (Fig. 63) is often used in cutting
curves, in chamfering, and for roughing out work. The
patent drawshave, with folding handles, is a safer tool to
keep in the tool box, as the edge is protected, but it is not
as satisfactory for general work as the ordinary rigid-handled
tool. If the latter is used, a piece of wood should
be fitted over the edge to protect both it and the hands
when the tool is not in use.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f64">
<img src="images/fig64.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.—Spokeshave.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>49. The spokeshave</b> (Fig. 64)
should not be used in any place
where a plane can be used, but
only upon concave or convex
surfaces; when used, it maybe either pushed or pulled.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f65">
<img src="images/fig65.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65.—Auger Bit.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>50. Bits</b> (<b>A.</b>) are of many different types, the most common
being the <i>auger bit</i> (Fig. 65). The use of the “worm”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
(<i>a</i>) is to draw the bit into the wood, thus making a heavy
pressure upon the bit unnecessary. The “lips” (<i>bb</i>)
make an incision on the
wood below the cut made
by the “cutters” (<i>cc</i>), which
take the shavings out and
into the “twist,” which in turn lifts them out of the hole.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f66">
<img src="images/fig66.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.—Cross-handled Auger.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Care should be used when boring a deep hole that
the bit is removed before the shavings clog in the twist,
which will happen if the hole becomes full of shavings
which cannot be lifted out. Should clogging occur, do
not use a great deal of strength in trying to back the bit
out, or its “shank” may be twisted off; it is better to pull
it out with a straight pull by means of a lever, if sufficient
strength cannot be otherwise exerted, the pull being
straight over the center of the bit from the “chuck,” not
from the head of the bitbrace.</p>

<p>After boring the hole to
the desired depth, do not
turn the bit backward to
remove it, as shavings will
be left in the hole, but give
it one turn back to loosen the
worm, then turn as though
boring the hole deeper, lifting
under the head of the
bitbrace in the meantime,
by which process the shavings
will be lifted out. These
bits are numbered from ³⁄₁₆ths to ¹⁶⁄₁₆ths inch by 16ths of
an inch. Sizes larger than these are known as augers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p class="caption"><i>A</i>, German bit;<br />

</div>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Large auger bits generally are fitted with cross
handles, as in Fig. 66, as a bitbrace will not give sufficient
leverage to make the bit cut the wood; these
are called augers. The form shown is known
as a “Ford auger.”</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) The <i>German bit</i> (Fig. 67, <i>A</i>) is used for
boring small holes for screws and nails, and
has entirely supplanted the gimlet of our forefathers,
as its action is much more rapid. Its
progression in sizes is from ¹⁄₁₆” to ¹²⁄₃₂” by 32ds
of an inch; this tool is also called a <i>screw bit</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f68">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span></p>
<p class="caption"><i>A</i>, extension bit;<br />
<i>B</i>, center bit.</p>
</div>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) The <i>twist drill</i> (Fig. 67, <i>B</i>) is a valuable
tool; every carpenter should own an
assortment of twist drills for use in places
where other bits may come in
contact with iron. The sizes
range from ¹⁄₁₆” to ⅝” by 32ds.
The round shank drill may be purchased
in any size up to 3”, by 64ths of an inch.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) The <i>extension bit</i> (Fig. 68, <i>A</i>) is a
very convenient tool for boring a hole of
any size within certain limits, and is at
times extremely valuable.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) The <i>center bit</i> (Fig. 68, <i>B</i>) is often
used in boring holes through thin material
which would be apt to be split if an auger
bit were used.</p>

<p>(<b>H.</b>) In filing an auger bit, it should be
held as shown in Fig. 69, and a small, fine
file used on the inside of the lips and the bottom of the
cutters; in no case should the outside of the lips be sharpened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
as the size of the bit will be reduced. In filing the
cutter, be sure that its under side back of the cutting
edge is filed enough
to clear the wood
after the cutter has
entered it.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f69">
<img src="images/fig69.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.—Filing an Auger Bit.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In doing this, it
should be remembered
that the bit progresses
into the wood
as it cuts, and unless
the under side of the
cutter is filed properly,
it will bear upon
the wood beneath it,
back of the cutting
edge, and prevent the
bit from advancing.
To remedy this, be
sure that the cutter
is kept filed thin, and that the under side is straight from
the edge to the beginning of the twist.</p>

<p>(<b>I.</b>) If the lips (Fig. 65, <i>bb</i>) are filed off, an auger bit
bores into the end wood easily.</p>

<p><b>51. The bitbrace, or stock.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) This tool is used
to hold the bit, and to furnish sufficient leverage to turn
the bit into the wood. Bitbraces are made of different
sizes, and with different devices for holding the “tangs” of
the bits. A workman should own an 8” and a 10” swing
bitbrace, as it is often necessary to use different sizes or
kinds of bits alternately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" id="f70">
<img src="images/fig70.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.—Ratchet Bitbrace.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The ratchet bitbrace (Fig. 70) differs from the
ordinary brace only in the ratchet attachment. It is an
indispensable tool to an up-to-date workman, as it may
be used in many places
where an ordinary brace
would be useless; for general
work, however, being
heavier, it is less convenient
than the plain brace.</p>

<p><b>52. The Screwdriver</b> (<b>A.</b>)
is one of the most important
tools in a carpenter’s kit, and to be of use should be of
finely tempered steel, for if too soft, it will turn over, and
if too hard, it will break. The edge should be as thick
as the slot of a screw will allow, in order to have as much
strength as possible.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) A round-handled screwdriver is not so satisfactory
as one with an elliptical or polygonal handle, as it is impossible
to obtain as good a grip upon the former as upon
the latter; a round handle, planed flat upon the two
opposite sides, is quite commonly used.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) <i>Ratchet screwdrivers</i> are useful in many places where
it is difficult to use two hands, and there are patent
quick-action screwdrivers on the market which are suitable
only for certain kinds of light work, as what is gained in
speed is lost in power. The screwdriver bit is a short
screwdriver blade, tanged to fit a bitbrace; it is essential
in doing economical work, as screws may be driven
much more rapidly than by hand, and it is also valuable
on account of its greater leverage in driving heavy
screws.</p>

</div>

<p><b>53. Compasses, or dividers</b> (Fig. 71), are used to draw
circles and curves, and for spacing and scribing, by which is
meant the process of fitting
a piece of wood to an uneven
surface. <i>Calipers</i> (Fig. 72)
are used to measure the outside
of a round or oval
object. Those shown are
known as “outside” calipers;
“inside” calipers, or
those used for measuring the
inside of a hole, have straight
legs. These tools ordinarily
are not considered a part of
a carpenter’s kit, as they are generally used upon work
requiring more exact measurements. Wood-workers’ tools
are graded to sizes, generally nothing finer than 16ths of
an inch; hence, the ordinary
methods of measuring will
usually give sufficiently accurate
results.</p>

</div>

<p><b>54. Pliers.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) These are
indispensable little tools (Fig.
73), and every workman
should own a pair. Those
combining several tools are
most useful; cheap tools of
this sort are usually worthless.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) <i>Nippers</i> (Fig. 74) are
made to cut wire, but not to pull nails. Being tempered
for cutting, those of good quality are hard and brittle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
lacking the toughness necessary to pull nails, for which
work a cheap pair of nippers may be purchased.</p>

<p><b>55. The scraper</b> is one of the most useful tools in the
kit of the carpenter who works upon hard wood. This
tool may be purchased, or made of a very hard saw; it
must be of hard, tough
steel, or the edge will not
last. A scraper should
be about 3” × 5”, which
is a convenient size for
grasping with the hand.
Many workmen make
handles for their scrapers
(Fig. 75, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>),
but cabinet makers, and
others who use them continually,
generally prefer
to use them without
handles. If a large surface
is to be scraped, it
is well to have a handle
of a leather palm (Fig.
75, <i>C</i>). This is a piece of leather of suitable size and
shape to protect the hand from the heat generated by the
action of the scraper in cutting; the thumb is passed
through the hole, and the broad part of the palm hangs
between the scraper and the thick of the hand. For scraping
floors, a scraper plane (Fig. 75, <i>D</i>) will be found valuable,
though if much of this work is to be done, it will be
the best economy to purchase one of the forms of floor-scraping
machines.</p>

sharpening scrapers,—the <i>square</i> and the <i>beveled</i> edge;
in sharpening either of these, the edge should be filed,
whetted, and turned with a burnisher, which
imparts a wire edge, indicated in Fig. 76, <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i>, which shows enlarged views of the two
forms of edges of scrapers. If the eye glances
along the edge of a properly sharpened
scraper, the edge will appear slightly curved;
this edge must be given it by filing. After
the scraper is filed, each corner which is to
be turned must be whetted to a perfectly
keen edge upon an oilstone, as the object of
sharpening a scraper is to “turn” this edge at an angle
with the sides of the scraper.</p>

<p class="caption"></p>
</div>

<p>By “turning” the edge of a scraper is meant pushing
the particles of steel which form the corner over so that
they will form a wire edge which will stand at an angle with
the sides of the scraper. When the edge has been skillfully
turned, it will cut like a very finely sharpened
and adjusted plane, and will work either with
or against the grain without tearing the wood.</p>

<p>Notice carefully the angle of the burnisher
with the sides of the scraper, as at <i>a</i>, Fig. 77,
and as in Fig. 78, which indicates approximately
the angle at which it should be held
across the edge when seen in the view illustrated
of either a square or beveled-edge
scraper, the vertical lines indicating the scraper. The
stroke must be from the bottom, up, as indicated. At <i>A</i>,
Fig. 79, is shown the top view of the burnisher as it makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
each of the strokes in turning the edge of a square edge
scraper; notice that the burnisher swings in an angle of
about 15°, one stroke only being made at each angle.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f78">
<img src="images/fig78.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.—Method of Grasping Scraper<br />
for Sharpening.</span></p>
</div>

<p>At <i>B</i>, Fig. 79, is shown the method of turning the edge
of a bevel edge scraper; the student will notice that the
angles are similar to
those shown at <i>A</i>,
except that the first
stroke is made at
nearly the same angle
as the bevel of the
scraper. An edge
may often be turned
at one stroke, and
more than three
should rarely be necessary.
If more than
three are made, the
edge may be turned
too far, which is
worse than not being
turned enough. The
strokes should be
made in the order
indicated by the figures of the angles of the burnisher;
otherwise it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The amount of pressure necessary to apply at this
stage of the work cannot be described, but can only be
discovered by practice. A steady, moderate pressure is
all that is needed, but care should be used that the angle
of the burnisher does not change during the stroke. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
will give an edge suitable for common counter or table
tops, hardwood floors, and similar work, if the skill to use
the burnisher properly has been acquired.</p>

<p>The burnisher should be slightly lubricated with oil
or with the end of the tongue, as this assists it to slide over
the edge of the scraper without scratching.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f79">
<img src="images/fig79.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.—Top Views of<br />
the Angles of the<br />
Burnisher.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If a scraper is to be used upon very fine work, a different
shaped edge should be made; it should be whetted to four
perfectly square and keen corners,
each of which will furnish an edge.
This is a more difficult method of
sharpening a scraper, but it gives
four edges suitable for fine work.
The edge should be turned by carrying
the burnisher as shown at <i>A</i>, Fig.
79, making the strokes at the different
angles in the order indicated by the numbers. In sharpening
any scraper, care should be used that no strokes
are made back of the square, as stroke <i>bc</i> of Fig. 80.
Keep the burnisher pointing down all the time, as indicated
at <i>a</i>, Fig. 77, as in this lies the chief difficulty. Two
or three strokes should be sufficient to sharpen the scraper.</p>

<p>To turn the edge of a scraper properly, a burnisher is
necessary. This tool should be made of the hardest steel,
and is often made by the workman himself of an old file,
ground perfectly smooth and polished. Perhaps the most
satisfactory burnisher within easy reach of the wood-worker
may be made from a nail set, which may be fitted to a
handle and ground to an awl point. The back of a narrow
chisel or gouge may be used, though these are rather
clumsy. The burnishers found in stores are generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
unsatisfactory, as they are apt to be soft, and any steel
which can be cut with a file is useless as a burnisher for
sharpening scrapers, as the scraper will cut
into it, instead of turning over.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f80">
<img src="images/fig80.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.—Angle<br />
to be Avoided<br />
in Sharpening<br />
Scraper.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If satisfactory results are not obtained,
there may be several causes: the scraper
may not be of just the right temper or texture;
the burnisher may be soft or rough;
the edge may not have been turned over
evenly, or it may have been turned over
too far, as indicated in an exaggerated way
at <i>a</i>, Fig. 80, which is the result of carrying
the burnisher around too far, as shown by
the line <i>bc</i>. This may be remedied by using the awl point
as shown at <i>d</i>, Fig. 81, holding the scraper and burnisher
in about the same relative positions as indicated, guiding
the burnisher by the thumb, which should be carried on
the square edge of the scraper, moving with the burnisher
its entire length. In this way the edge may be turned
back to its correct angle, when a very light touch in the
usual way will generally make the desired edge.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f81">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.—<br />
Turning<br />
Back the<br />
Edge of a<br />
Scraper.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If either the scraper or the burnisher is not
of the right texture, throw it away, as it is
worthless. If the burnisher is rough, it may
be made smooth upon an oilstone. If the edge
of the scraper is rough, it may be turned back
again by laying the scraper flat upon the
bench, the rough side up, and the burnisher
passed over it several times; then proceed as
with a new edge. In general, this is not so satisfactory
as it is to file, whet, and sharpen the edge all over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
again, especially if the corner has been turned several
times.</p>

<p>Though it may seem from the above explanation of the
methods of sharpening scrapers that it is a very complex
operation, it will be
seen that it is not a
difficult matter, if it
is once worked out;
usually it requires a
little time and practice
to acquire the
knack that will make
it possible to do it
surely and well.</p>

</div>

<p>In using a scraper,
it may be grasped as
shown in Figs. 82, 83,
84, as best suits the
work being done, and
the strokes should be
with the grain. In
using this tool, as in
the use of most others,
the easiest way generally is the most efficient. As the
young workman gains experience, he will gradually acquire
the correct methods to use his tools for all the various
purposes within their scope.</p>

<p><b>57. Nail sets</b> are for the purpose of “setting” the nails,
or for sinking them below the surface of the wood; and to
stand the hard usage to which they are subjected, they
must be very carefully tempered. The best form of nail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
set is that which has a cupped or hollow point, as it is not
so apt to slip off of the head of the nail.</p>

<p><b>58. Wrenches</b> are of many kinds and patterns and of
every conceivable use, but
that known as the “monkey,”
or “Coe’s,” wrench
(Fig. 85) is perhaps the most
convenient for general work
and has not been supplanted by any of more recent
invention.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f85">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.—Monkey Wrench.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>59. Handscrews</b> (<b>A.</b>), if of good material and well made,
will stand any legitimate use, and if properly used and
cared for, will last a lifetime. However, a novice or a
careless workman often destroys them rapidly by allowing
the jaws to be under strain while in the position shown in
Fig. 86, which
will probably
break the middle
screw, and perhaps
both.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f86">
<img src="images/fig86.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86.—Effect of the Unskillful Use of a<br />
Handscrew.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In using
handscrews for
gluing, the jaws
should be set to
nearly the size
of the material
which is to be
placed between
them, before the glue is spread. In placing the handscrews
upon the work, the outside screw should be turned
back so that it will not prevent the jaws from being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
slightly closer at the outside screw than at the points.
This will allow the strain which is applied in setting up the
outside screw, to bring the jaws parallel, which is the only
position in which handscrews should be allowed to remain.</p>



<p>In opening or closing
a handscrew, the
middle screw should
be held in the left
hand, and the outside
screw in the right,
as in Fig. 87; the
screws should then be
grasped so that they
will not turn in the
hand and the handscrew
revolved in
the desired direction.
Never put unnecessary
strain upon
handscrews, nor leave
them with a heavy
strain upon them for a very long time.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f87">
<img src="images/fig87.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.—Correct Use of Handscrew.</span></p>
</div>

<p>If the work is well fitted, no more strain should be used
than is necessary to bring the joints well up, and no work
should be glued unless the joints fit well. In any case,
the outside screw should be turned back a quarter or a half
a turn after the glue has set; this will relieve the strain,
and add much to the life of the handscrew.</p>

<p>In gluing work which requires several handscrews to
hold it while the glue is setting, the handles of the outside
screws all should point one way, which allows the work to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
be handled much more easily, as the handles of the middle
screws will form an even bearing upon the floor. If this
is not done, the outside screws will be apt to be broken
when a heavy piece of work is being glued and handled,
as the weight of the work will rest upon the screws which
bear upon the floor.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Before using new handscrews, the screws should be
treated with beeswax and beef tallow, or with black lead
mixed with oil or with wax. The latter compound is very
dirty; the former lubricates the screws perfectly. The
screws should be heated, and the lubricant applied hot.</p>

<p><b>60.</b> (<b>A.</b>) <b>A grindstone</b> of good quality, from 20” to 26”
in diameter, is indispensable to a woodworking shop, and
should be used frequently, as the efficiency of cutting tools
is much increased if they are kept well ground, and much
time may be saved in whetting them.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In selecting a grindstone, be sure that it is true
and round, and of a coarse, even grit, which can be quite
satisfactorily determined by examining several and selecting
the coarsest, as that will doubtlessly be a fast cutting
stone.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) The stone should be carefully centered and
mounted upon a frame; the face may be kept true by
means of a file or other hard steel being held against it
as it revolves, or a piece of ½” or ¾” gas pipe revolved from
side to side of the stone as it is turned. Never allow a
stone to rest with one side in the water, as it will be made
softer and heavier upon that side, and soon worn out of
true.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Do not use one place upon the surface of the stone
continually, or a groove will quickly be worn there; instead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
keep the tool moving from side to side. If properly
cared for, a stone will hold its face indefinitely.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f88">
<img src="images/fig88.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.—Emery Wheel Dresser.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>61. Emery, corundum, carborundum</b>, and other artificial
abrasive wheels have in many cases supplanted the grindstone,
as they cut much more rapidly. Any one not
accustomed to using them must be careful that the temper
of the tool is not destroyed, as the wheel runs at a high
rate of speed, and a tool in
unskillful hands is easily
burned. To avoid this, the
tool should be held lightly
but firmly against the stone,
and frequently dipped in water to cool it. If an emery
wheel burns badly, it may be because it needs dressing;
for this purpose a diamond emery wheel dresser is the
best, but on account of its cost, various devices have
been patented to accomplish the same result, one of which
is illustrated in Fig. 88.</p>

<p><b>62. Whetstones.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) These are used to give to a tool
the keen edge necessary to cut wood smoothly. The
natural stone in most common use is the “Washita stone,”
which is quarried in the Ozark Mountains, and is thought
by many to be the best natural stone for the general use
of the wood-worker; it is fast cutting, and when of the
best quality is of even texture.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Many workmen prefer an “Arkansas stone,” as it is
finer and harder than the Washita. It is also more expensive,
however, and is better adapted to the use of
woodcarvers and engravers than to the use of wood-workers
in general. It is usually not so fast cutting as the best of
the Washita stones, but a finer edge may be obtained by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
its use. There are other natural stones, but none so
generally used as the above. The purchase of a natural
stone is to a great extent a lottery, as only about one
stone in ten has a perfectly even texture, is free from
cracks, and has reasonably good cutting qualities.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) If a stone needs truing, lay a piece of coarse sandpaper
upon a board, and rub the stone over it until it has
been ground down. The best place, however, to true up
a whetstone is upon the horizontal stone of a marble
worker; this is a large grindstone, several feet in diameter,
mounted on a vertical shaft, upon which are placed
pieces of marble to be ground to a flat surface.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) <i>Artificial oilstones</i>, made of emery, corundum,
carborundum, and other artificial abrasives, are coming
rapidly into use, and, as in the case of grindstones, eventually
will supplant all others in many occupations, as
they cut faster than any natural stone, may be made of
any degree of fineness, and are of absolutely even texture.
They are also able to resist many accidents which would
destroy a natural stone.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) <i>Slip stones</i> are used to sharpen gouges and curved
tools of all kinds, and may be made in any desirable shape.
An oblong stone, 8” × 2” × 1”, is the size of stone in most
general use by the wood-worker, and should be fitted into
a box or piece of wood with a cover to keep it clean. It
may be laid either flat or on its edge, as suits the workman,
though the stone may be kept true more easily if it is set
on its edge.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) The use of the oilstone is described under topic
<b>40, A.</b> The oil used should be a kind that will not gum;
its purpose is to prevent the glassiness which is caused by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the friction of the tool over the stone. Common machine
oil is used by many, lard oil by others, and kerosene, or
coal oil, is claimed by many workmen to be the only oil
suitable for use upon an oilstone. Any one of these oils
will give satisfactory results, but kerosene keeps the stone
cleaner, thereby adding to its efficiency, and for this purpose
lubricates quite as well as any of those above-mentioned.</p>

<p><b>63.</b> (<b>A.</b>) <b>Files</b> are used for many purposes by wood-workers.
An assortment consisting of 4” and 6” slim taper,
or three-cornered, files; 8” and 10” flat, or bastard, files;
8”, 10”, and 12” round files; and 8” and 12” half round wood
files and rasps should be in every carpenter’s kit. The
4” slim taper files should be used upon the finer saws, and
the 6” upon the coarser ones, though the latter are used
by some workmen for both saws. Upon jobbing work, it
is necessary to have a few warding and knife files to use
upon keys and odd jobs, and also to sharpen bits.</p>

<p>Files and rasps are made of every shape and size, and
for every purpose. Wood files usually are tempered to
stand lead or soft brass, and should never be used upon
anything harder.</p>

<p>In drawing a file back between the cuts, do not allow
it to drag, as it is injured thereby about as much as when
it is cutting.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) There are a great many other tools and appliances
used by the wood-worker with which the workman should
be familiar, but it is not necessary to describe them,
as the above-mentioned are the most essential tools
common to all forms of woodworking. There is no important
principle involved in the construction, care, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
use of woodworking tools which is not discussed in this
chapter, and the student who becomes thoroughly familiar
with the matter treated will have little trouble in learning
to handle other tools.</p>

<img src="images/fig89.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89.—Jointing a Saw.</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>64. Saw filing.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) This is an accomplishment
which every young wood-worker should master, as its
possession will save expense and inconvenience, and add
much to his efficiency as a workman.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The first step in sharpening a saw is to examine
the edge carefully to see if the teeth are of an even length;
if they are not, they should be jointed. This is done by
using a flat file held perfectly square in a block, as shown in
Fig. 89. One or two light strokes usually will be enough
to make all the teeth of the same length. The edge of
the saw should round slightly in the middle, say about
⅛” for a 24” or a 26” saw. If the edge is perfectly straight,
it should not be jointed to this shape at once, but a little
at each time for several filings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" id="f90">
<img src="images/fig90.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.—Hand Saw Set.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) After jointing the saw, be sure that it is properly
set. This may be done by a <i>saw set</i>, of which there are
several patterns in use; these are all of two types, the
<i>hand set</i> (Fig. 90), and the
<i>anvil set</i> (Fig. 91). Either of
these forms is efficient, but
as it is more convenient, the
hand set is more commonly
used. Do not give the saw
too much set, or it will not
cut smoothly, but will break the wood badly on the back
side of the cut; there is also greater danger of breaking
the teeth, and as more wood is cut out, more muscle must
be applied. The point of the teeth only should be set,
and care should be used that the blade of the saw is not
sprung, which will be apt to result from setting the teeth
too far from the point.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f91">
<img src="images/fig91.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.—Anvil Saw<br />
Set.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A saw to be used upon green lumber should have
coarser teeth and more set than one which is to be used
upon thoroughly dry, seasoned wood. A panel saw intended
for use upon fine finishing work
usually is ground so thin upon the
back that it needs little or no set.
Some workmen set a saw so heavily
that it will do for several filings;
while this is satisfactory for a soft saw
to be used upon common work, it is not
a good plan to treat a fine, hard saw
this way, though the latter may be touched up once or twice.</p>

<div class="figright" id="f92">
<img src="images/fig92.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.—Angle of the File<br />
with the Edge of the<br />
Saw.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) In filing, it is important that the file should be
carried at the same angle the entire length of both sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of the blade. For a cutting-off saw, the file should be
carried at an angle with the side of the blade of from 60°
for soft wood to 70° for hard wood, as shown in Fig. 92;
and for general work, at an angle
about halfway between the two.
The file may be carried horizontally,
as at <i>aa</i>, Fig. 93, which
makes all the teeth of the same
size; as at <i>A</i>, Fig. 94; or it may be
carried as at <i>bb</i>, Fig. 93, which will
make the teeth of the shape shown
at <i>B</i>, Fig. 94. The latter method
is preferred by many workmen, as
it allows the file to run more smoothly, thus lengthening
its life a little. There is no difference in the efficiency of
the saws filed by these methods, but if filed as at <i>bb</i>, Fig.
93, it is more difficult to keep the teeth of the same size,
and to make a good-looking job.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="f93">
<img src="images/fig93.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.—Angle of the<br />
File with the Sides<br />
of the Saw.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In filing a cutting-off saw, the top of the file should be
held more or less slantingly, as shown in Fig. 95, according
to the hook which it is desired that
the teeth shall have. The more
hook a saw has, the faster it will
cut, but the cut will be rougher in
proportion. Experience is necessary
to discover just the right angles at
which the file should be held; after
considerable practice, the file will
naturally drop into the correct position.</p>

<p>File every tooth upon each side of the saw to a perfect
point, one half of the filing being done from each side; file<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the entire length from one side, then reverse the saw and
file from the other side. This cannot always be the exclusive
practice if a saw is in very bad shape, because if the
teeth are of uneven sizes, care must
be used, and more filed from some
teeth than from others. It may, in
such a case, be necessary to go over
the saw two or three times, but it
should be done very carefully, so that
the bevel of the teeth may be preserved
and their length kept the same. Observe each
tooth, and press toward the point or the handle of the
saw, as may be necessary. The file should be carried
with its point toward the point of the saw, filing the cutting
or the front side of the tooth of the farther side of
the saw, and the back of the tooth next ahead on the
nearer side with the same stroke. If the point of the saw
is carried toward the handle of the saw, it makes the teeth
chatter, and upon a hard saw, may make them break. It
also causes an excruciating noise, and shortens the life
of a file, as the continuous
chatter against its teeth
will soon break them, and
destroy the file.</p>

<p>A ripsaw requires more
set than a cutting-off saw,
and if, as usual, the file

be filed from one side.</p>

flat surface, and given a light touch with a flat file or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>

<p>The teeth of the compass saw should be a combination
of the rip- and the cutting-off saw, as it does the work of
both as occasion requires. The teeth should be nearly
as hooking as those of a ripsaw, and the front teeth filed
at an angle of about 80° with the side of the saw. In
filing the back of the teeth, the hand should be carried a
little lower than horizontal. Figure 41, <i>C</i>, shows three

<p class="c large"><span class="smcap">Glue and Sandpaper</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">65. Different kinds of glue.</span>—(<b>A.</b>) Wood-workers use
both <i>liquid</i> and <i>sheet</i> or <i>stick</i> glue, but as the former
requires little skill in its use, we will deal principally with
the latter, which is made of hides, sinews, bones, and
waste material of slaughterhouses. Different grades of
glue are made of various kinds of refuse, but the processes
of treating them all are similar.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The material from which glue is to be made is
steeped in lime water at low temperature, or subjected to
a chemical treatment for a sufficient time to separate the
fat from the fiber. The latter is then washed in clean
water and boiled down to gelatin, which is spread upon
wires to dry and harden, when it is ready for use.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) <i>Ground glue</i> makes up more readily than that
which comes in sheets, and therefore is preferred by many
workmen. It is frequently adulterated, but if made upon
honor, it is as good as the glue from which it is made, and
does not deteriorate unless kept for a long time in a damp
place. As it is not possible to apply certain tests to ground
glue which may be used upon that in sheets or sticks,
many workmen prefer not to use it unless sure of its
quality.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) The highest-priced glue is not always the best for
all purposes, and a dealer who handles different grades can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
generally advise which should be used, though the medium
grade in common use is usually satisfactory for general
work.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) It is impossible to give infallible rules for testing
glue in the stick, or to say that glue should be of any
special color, or that it should be either transparent or
opaque; but, in general, glue suitable for ordinary work
will be of a reddish, yellowish, or light brownish color, clear
and transparent, and not offensive to either taste or smell,
though some of the best makes of glue are absolutely
opaque. Good glue will swell in cold water, but will not
dissolve until it has nearly reached the boiling point. It
will also absorb more water than will poor glue, and is
therefore more economical. Any test which depends upon
the brittleness or dryness of the glue is not reliable, as
a somewhat damp, good glue will not stand this test as
well as a poor glue that is very dry. If conditions are the
same, and comparison is possible, it is fairly safe to assume
that if a good glue is cut with a sharp knife, a hard, elastic
shaving will result, while a poor glue will give a shaving
which is extremely brittle, and will break into little pieces.</p>

<p>A safe way to test glue is to prepare a number of pieces
of the same kind of wood, 1” square and about 12” long,
fit them perfectly end to end in pairs, and glue as many
of them together as there are samples of glue to be tested.
After the glue is thoroughly hard, clamp one of the pieces
of each pair to a bench top, with the joint coinciding with
the edge. Hang a pail about 10” from the joint on the
piece which projects over the edge of the bench, and allow
sand to run into it slowly, until the joint breaks. Repeat
this process with each pair which has been glued up, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the amount of sand necessary to break the joint will furnish
a basis of comparison between the different varieties
of glue tested.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) Glue should be soaked in cold or lukewarm water
before being put into a glue pot, which should be a double
vessel, with the glue in the inside pot, and the hot water or
steam in the outer jacket. In making up glue, it should be
brought to the boiling point until melted, and then removed
from the heat, for if kept continually hot, it loses much
of its strength by being cooked too much, as this makes
continual thinning necessary.</p>

<p>If time will not permit, the preliminary soaking may be
dispensed with, and the hard glue put at once in the hot
water, in which case it must be stirred frequently while
melting, or it will form a mass. If the water boils out of
the outside kettle, and the glue burns, throw it away, as it
is worthless.</p>

<p>Glue should be thinned with cold water, after which it
should be allowed to become thoroughly heated before
using; in the shops, this is not always done, as there may
not be time to allow the glue to become heated again;
therefore it is quite the common custom to thin the glue
with hot water.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) Paint brushes, or other brushes in which the
bristles are set in glue, are not suitable for use in hot glue,
and those made especially for this purpose should be
purchased. For very small brushes, a strip of basswood
bark may be soaked and pounded about half an inch from
the end; these are satisfactory for small work.</p>

<p><b>66. How to use glue.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Glue should be used as
hot as possible, and of about the consistency of cream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
The pieces to be glued should be heated thoroughly and
the gluing done in a warm room.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In factories, where it is possible, the gluing is done
in a specially fitted room which contains all necessary
appliances. Vertical and horizontal coils of steam pipes
surround the room, both to furnish heat for the room, and
for the purpose of heating the material to be glued, which
should be so hot that the hand cannot rest upon it for
more than a few seconds. In a room of this sort, the
temperature is maintained at from 110° to 130° F.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) If the best possible results are wanted, a <i>scratch
plane</i> should be used. This is a tool similar to a smoother,
only its cutter is nearly vertical, and it has teeth like a
fine saw which will scratch the wood, thus giving a better
hold for the glue.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) It is important that all clamps, handscrews, and
other appliances which are likely to be needed should be
set as nearly as possible the desired size, and so arranged
as to be reached easily, for when the glue is applied, there
should not be the slightest hesitation or delay in getting
the work together and the clamps on. The utmost speed
and surety of motion is absolutely necessary in using hot
glue; therefore everything during the process of the
work should be foreseen and provision made for it before
the glue is applied, for if the glue is even slightly chilled,
the work will not be so well done, and the efficiency of the
glue will be greatly diminished. A novice should never
attempt more than the simplest work, unless working with
a competent man.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) The glue should be spread rapidly and evenly with
a brush of suitable size,—a large one for broad surfaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and a small one for small work. Glue should not be
thrown about wastefully; enough should be used to cover
the surface completely but not thickly.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) In using handscrews, it is of the greatest importance
that the jaws be kept parallel as described in Topic
<b>59</b>; care must be used that more strain is not placed upon
the handscrews and clamps than is necessary to bring the
joint together.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) Cold or liquid glue has supplanted hot glue in
furniture repairing, gluing up intricate work, and in
places where it is impracticable to use hot glue either
on account of its setting too rapidly, or where heat is
not available. Liquid glue does not hold as well nor as
permanently as hot glue when properly used, but for many
kinds of work it is perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>(<b>H.</b>) In gluing rosewood, or other woods of a greasy
nature, the glue should be thinned with vinegar, which will
cut the grease. Another method of making glue hold on
wood of this sort is to chalk both members of the joint
thoroughly, and let it stand for two or three hours, when
it should be wiped off. This absorbs the grease on the
surface of the wood, which allows the glue to take hold.
In all gluing, do not allow the bare hand to touch the joint
any more than necessary, as the grease and perspiration
will prevent the best results from being obtained.</p>

<p><b>67. The testing of sandpaper.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Sandpaper is
made by covering paper with a thin layer of glue, over
which is spread evenly a layer of ground flint or glass;
over this is spread another coating of glue, which firmly
fastens the sand to the paper.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In buying sandpaper, pass the finger over it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
see if the sand is firmly fastened. Be sure that the paper
is neither flimsy nor brittle. Coarse particles of sand are
sometimes found upon sandpaper which renders it worthless;
these can be detected only by use, unless they are
very prominent.</p>

<p><b>68. How to use sandpaper.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) Sandpaper is made
in numbers, 00, 0, ½, 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3. Numbers 00 and 0
are very fine, and are used in rubbing down shellac and
varnish. Numbers ½ and 1 are used in sandpapering
mahogany and other fancy woods, and number 1½ is used
upon all building finish but the finest; the coarser numbers
are used upon floors, outside finish, and other coarse
work which is to be painted, though for a very nice floor,
1½ is used, rarely anything finer. It is a fallacy to think
that the finer the sandpaper used, the finer the job will be,
since upon some kinds of woods fine sandpaper will make
a glassy surface in spots which will not take the finish like
the rest of the work. Sandpapering is as apt to detract
from the work as it is to improve it, for unless used very
skillfully, the character of angles and small surfaces will be
changed, though it may seem that the damage is so slight
as to be imperceptible. In using sandpaper, the workman
should guard against rounding off square corners or destroying
the form of surfaces; a raw corner, however,
should be removed with a few light, careful strokes, as a
perfectly sharp corner will always be more or less ragged.</p>

<p><i>The one who knows</i> will always notice the omissions of
details of this sort, and will attribute such imperfections
to lack of skill or knowledge on the part of the workman.
It is for the one who knows, that all work should be done—not
for the casual observer—and these apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
insignificant details, rather than the part of the work
which may seem of more importance, form the basis by
which one workman judges the work of another. In
nothing do small things count more than in making or
destroying a workman’s reputation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f97">
<img src="images/fig97.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.—Use of Sandpaper upon a Broad Surface.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Keep the sandpaper dry, and stored in a dry place,
as moisture softens the glue so that the sand may be easily
rubbed off. In handling sandpaper, care should be taken
that the sanded sides are not rubbed together.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) In preparing to sandpaper a flat surface, or for
general work, a sheet of sandpaper should be torn in
halves the short way of the paper, and one half should
be folded back to back, and held (not tacked) around the
block with the hand, as in Fig. 97. The act of grasping
the block for the work will hold the sandpaper, and any
device for holding the sandpaper on the block is worthless,
being considered by the workman as a mark of the
novice. The block should be about 3” × 4” × ⅞”, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
may be made of wood, cork, fiber, or any material which
suits the taste of the workman.</p>

<p>If there is much sandpapering of moldings to be done,
it is best to make blocks which will fit the contour of them,
as it is very hard on the hands to do this work for very
long at a time, though nothing has ever been invented
which fits irregular forms as well as the fingers. A piece
of sandpaper <i>should never be used on a piece of work until
all the cutting by edge tools has been done</i>, as the particles of
sand will enter the grain of the wood, and any edge tools
used upon it afterward will be quickly dulled. Do not
use a piece of sandpaper so large that any part of it will
not be under perfect control, as loose ends will scratch the
wood, and it has an awkward and unworkmanlike appearance.
Always work parallel with the grain, and be sure
that all plane marks and rough places are thoroughly
rubbed down. In order to do this well, it is often necessary
to use considerable muscle. This part of the work calls
for good judgment, for unless sandpapered enough, there
will be places which will show when the finish is spread
on the work, though they may have been invisible before.
No one can tell as well as the workman himself when sufficient
sandpapering has been done, though it may be evident
to any one who knows the signs whether or not the
work has been done judiciously. Upon a coarse job it is
usually allowable, and sometimes desirable, to sandpaper
across the grain, especially if the work is to be painted.</p>

<p>In order to impress it upon the student, we will repeat
that <i>too much care cannot be taken in the use of sandpaper</i>,
for much oftener will an amateur injure a piece of work
than improve it.</p>

<img src="images/fig98.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.—Sandpapering Panel<br />
Work.</span></p>
<p class="caption">(For explanation, see text.)</p>
</div>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) In sandpapering panel work, as in Fig. 98, the
panels (<i>a</i>) should be smoothed, scraped, and sandpapered,
and the edges of the stiles (<i>b</i>), rails (<i>d</i>), and muntins (<i>e</i>)
should be treated the same way
before the panel work is put together;
an exception to this in
regard to the panels may be made
if the panel frame is constructed
in such a way as to allow the panels
to be put in place after it is together,
in which case the panels
may be smoothed at any time.
Upon very fine work the panels
are sometimes polished before
being put in place, as it is difficult
for the finisher to work into the corners after the panels
are in place. After the faces of the stiles, rails, and muntins
have been planed and scraped, they should be sandpapered
in the order named, working with the sandpaper over a
sharp-cornered block close to the edges of the pieces,
being careful not to drag the paper over the face of the
pieces which join at right angles. The stiles, rails, and
muntins should be sandpapered in the order in which
they are mentioned. If the sandpaper runs over the rails
a little when sandpapering the muntins, or over the stiles
when sanding the rails, it will do no harm, as a couple of
light, careful strokes parallel with the grain will be sufficient
to remove any scratches which may be made.</p>

<p>In sanding mahogany, or any wood of which the grain
rubs up, make the strokes in one direction only, instead
of back and forth. Sometimes wax is rubbed in to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the grain down upon cheap work, but this is not recommended,
as that place will not take the stain or the finish
like the rest of the wood. A very thin coat of shellac is
used for the same purpose; this is less objectionable, but
should be avoided if possible.</p>

<p class="c large"><span class="smcap">Wood Finishing</span></p>

<p><b>69. Filling.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) After wood has been smoothed and
made ready to receive the finish, it is prepared by <i>filling</i>,
by which is meant the process of filling the grain so that
the finish itself will not soak in. This, if well done,
makes it possible to do as good a job of finishing with
two or three coats as could be done on some kinds of wood
with from five to eight coats without the filling. Open-grained
woods, such as oak, ash, etc., especially need
filling, as before the process of filling was discovered, the
open grain, or cellular part of the wood, had to be filled
by shellac, or other expensive material, before there was
a surface suitable to receive the polish. (<b>B.</b>) There are
two forms of filler—<i>the paste</i>, which is for use upon open-grained
woods, and <i>the liquid</i>, which is adapted to filling
the pores of close-grained woods like pine, poplar, cherry,
etc., and which takes the place of one coat of the more expensive
shellac or other finish. The paste may be purchased
ready-made, and colored to suit the taste, or it may be
made by using whiting, silex, or corn starch, and any dry
colors necessary to secure the desired stain. The ingredients
should be well ground, and thoroughly mixed
with boiled linseed oil to a thick paste; to this should be
added as much japan drier as there is of the oil, or one
quarter as much as there is of the paste. The whole may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
then be thinned with turpentine, benzine, or gasolene
to a consistency which will allow it to be spread easily,
but it should still be quite thick.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Filler need not be spread very smoothly, but the
surface of the wood must be covered, and the filling
thoroughly worked into the grain. After this has been
done, the wood should be allowed to stand a few minutes,
until the filler has become dull or powdery, and seems to
stick to the wood if rubbed lightly with the finger, when
it should be rubbed off with shavings or excelsior, rubbing
across the grain wherever possible. Do not use cloth until
cleaning up after the filler is all off, as it is more apt to
take the filling out of the grain than either excelsior or
shavings. The corners should be cleaned out with a
sharp stick, after which the work should stand for several
hours, or over night, before the finish is applied, as otherwise
the moisture in the filler may cause the finish to
bubble. Care should be used that the filling does not
stand too long before rubbing off, or it will be very difficult
to remove it; hence, it is best not to spread any more than
can be cleaned off before it gets too hard. Be sure that
there is enough filling mixed to do the job before any is
applied, as it is difficult to match colors.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Liquid filling should be spread as smoothly and
as evenly as possible, as the laps will be apt to show
through the finish which is spread over it.</p>

<p><b>70. Staining wood</b> (<b>A.</b>) is for the purpose of imparting
some other than the natural color to the wood.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) In finishing open-grained woods, a stain often is
used which will color the wood before it is filled, though
upon general work, it is the custom to color the stain only.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
This does not make the work all of one color, as the cells
of the wood will retain more filling than will the harder
part of the grain. By this method the quarter grain may
be made more prominent. If an open-grained wood is
being treated, it should be filled after being stained.
Close-grained woods are ready for the finish as soon as the
stain has dried. Stains which will do the work satisfactorily
may be made of various chemicals. There are
also many satisfactory stains upon the market, which can
be purchased in as small packages as desired, offering the
student a large range of colors from which to select.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) Stains for close-grained woods may be made by
mixing dry colors with turpentine or benzine, and a little
boiled oil and japan to bind the color. These stains should
be applied the same as the filler, but not allowed to become
so hard before cleaning off, or there will be light places
rubbed in the finish. The rubbing or cleaning off should
be done with a soft cloth, care being used that there are
no places left uncleaned, especially in the corners, as the
finish will make them muddy.</p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) A very good <i>old cherry</i> stain may be made by mixing
Venetian red and rose pink until the desired shade is
produced.</p>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) <i>Black walnut</i> may be imitated by mixing burnt
umber with turpentine, oil, and japan, and if a reddish
tinge is desired, a little burnt sienna may be added; this
is a much better color than can be produced by umber
alone. Asphaltum, thinned to the desired color, makes a
good walnut stain.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) Many of the best stains are mixed with water as
a vehicle, as a depth and brilliancy of color may be obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
which is impossible with any stain that has oil in
it. The objection to using water is that the grain of the
wood is lifted by the moisture, and has to be sanded smooth
before it can be finished. Even with this serious objection,
water stains are used extensively upon the best work.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) The rich mahogany stain which is so much admired
may be made by mixing the same colors as mentioned
in (<b>D.</b>), and adding carmine until the desired color
is obtained. An oil stain will not give the best results,
therefore a water stain should be used, with a piece of gum
arabic about twice the size of a pea dissolved in a pint or
less of the stain for a binder, or about the same proportion
of mucilage. This stain should be cleaned off the same as
the oil stain above described.</p>

<p>(<b>H.</b>) Cherry may be darkened by applying nitric acid;
other woods may be darkened or aged by using ammonia,
potash, or a strong solution of tobacco or coffee. Nitrate of
silver, if exposed to the sunlight, gives a beautiful brown.</p>

<p>(<b>I.</b>) A rich brown may be produced by using equal parts
of permanganate of potash and sulphate of magnesia, dissolved
in water; as many coats as desired may be applied,
sanding with number 00 sandpaper between the coats.
Better results are obtained if the stain is applied hot.</p>

<p>(<b>J.</b>) A beautiful green of any intensity may be produced
by mixing verdigris and indigo in hot vinegar, and
applying hot. Several coats may be necessary, sanding
between the coats. The indigo should be used cautiously,
or the green may have too much of a bluish cast.</p>

<p>(<b>K.</b>) A rich brownish black may be obtained by using a solution
of logwood (pulverized) and sulphate of iron, applied
in coats in the order named. Each solution should be hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>(<b>L.</b>) <i>Ebony</i> may be obtained by giving any close-grained
wood, cherry preferred, a coat of sulphate of iron, using
a weak solution, and after that has dried and been sanded,
a coat of solution of nutgalls. If the iron is too strong, a
white efflorescence will appear, which in open-grained
woods will bring out the grain in strong relief. If this is
objectionable, the grain should be filled with a black filler.</p>

<p>(<b>M.</b>) <i>Shellac</i> (see <b>71, A.</b>) and boneblack, if well mixed,
make an ebony finish which is often used upon common
work; black varnish sometimes is used the same as black
shellac, but for the best work these are not satisfactory,
as they do not strike into the wood to the same extent as
do acid, turpentine, or water stain.</p>

<p><b>71. Shellac.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) This is a product of Africa and
South America. It is the combination of a secretion of
the female of a small insect and the sap of a tree, in the
bark of which the insect deposits its eggs. The gum thus
formed is gathered, and after passing through various refining
processes becomes the shellac known to commerce.
It is cut or dissolved by either wood or grain alcohol,
when it is ready for use. Some of the best furniture is
finished with shellac, and unless continuously exposed to
moisture or hard usage, the finish is practically everlasting.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Shellac finish does not crack as varnish is liable
to, neither does its luster dim by exposure to the various
gases present in every house, which are due to domestic
causes, though most varnishes will do this after some years.</p>

<p>Upon ordinary work, two coats of shellac may be satisfactory,
though three coats generally will improve the
work sufficiently to make it advisable to apply the extra
coat. Shellac should not be laid in too thick coats, or it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
will pit badly in drying, and make work in rubbing to a
surface, which can be avoided if moderately thin coats are
spread, though perhaps the greatest advantage in laying
thin coats is that the wood may be covered more evenly,
and there will be fewer runs and laps visible. Shellac
should always be laid with quick strokes, never working
over a place already covered; for this work, use a brush as
large as possible to do the work without clumsiness.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) In applying shellac finish, one coat is laid upon the
other, each coat being rubbed down with number 00 sandpaper,
or with pulverized pumice stone before the next
coat is spread. For this purpose, a sheet of sandpaper
should be cut into eighths, and one of these pieces folded
in the center of its long dimension, and held in the hand
as shown in Fig. 99, which keeps its edges from scratching
the surface. If it is desired to rub the shellac down to a
surface with pumice stone, it should be applied with hair-cloth,
or with harness maker’s felt, moistened with oil or
water; but for ordinary work, sandpaper will give satisfaction,
and as it is more convenient, it is much used.</p>

<p>If the best results are desired, the last coat should be
rubbed with pumice stone and sweet oil, applied as above,
though boiled oil is satisfactory; and for ordinary work,
number 00 sandpaper is used, though it is liable to show
scratches. After the rubbing is done, the oil should be
wiped off with a soft rag, and very fine rotten stone dusted
on and polished with a clean, soft cloth. Many finishers
use the palm of the hand in putting on the finishing touches.
If a dead, or mat, finish is desired, the final rubbing should
be done with water, used sparingly, as oil imparts a high
gloss, if the work is well done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>(<b>D.</b>) Care should be used on any kind of work upon
which waste or oily rags are used; these rags should be
gathered and burned unless they are wanted again soon,
in which case they may be spread out separately; since,
if crushed together and thrown, as they often are, into
a waste box, they furnish the necessary conditions for a
case of spontaneous combustion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="f99">
<img src="images/fig99.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.—Method of Grasping Sandpaper in Rubbing Down Shellac<br />
Finish.</span></p>
</div>

<p>(<b>E.</b>) The gloss upon dried shellac and varnishes of all
kinds is very showy, and lacks the finish and the texture of
a rubbed finish. Moreover, any dust settling upon moist
varnish is held, giving the surface an effect of countless
minute points; rubbing removes these, and gives the
smooth, glossy surface desired upon most work. Upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the most artistic furniture, a gloss, which is the result of
a built-up polish, is not considered good taste; the use of
muscle and a very little oil, applied at intervals during a
term of years, gives a polish and a beauty which can be
obtained by no other method, and it is to attain this ideal
in a few days that so many varieties of finish exist.</p>

<p>(<b>F.</b>) In rubbing, be sure that the corners are not rubbed
through, as the pressure will naturally be more upon the
corners than upon a broad surface. This may be avoided by
using care that the pressure is not applied so as to bear
on the corner; grasp the rubbing material in such a way
that no loose edges will be beyond control, as in Fig. 99,
or the finish may be badly scratched; this applies especially
to the corners. The rubbing should always be
in the direction parallel with the grain of the wood.</p>

<p>(<b>G.</b>) If the finish is rubbed through to the wood, it
may be repolished or patched by sandpapering the bare
wood with fine sandpaper, and staining it to bring it to
the same condition as the rest of the wood before the first
coat of finish was applied. Using the same finishing
material as the finish of the rest of the piece, lay a very
thin coat, a little larger than the place to be patched, being
careful to avoid a ridge at the edge of the patch. This
ridge may be drawn out by a small camel’s-hair brush, and
the patch left until thoroughly dried; then apply another
patch a little larger than the first one, treating the edge
as in the first patch. Continue this until the finish is built
up to the same thickness as that of which it is a part.
This should be rubbed very carefully to bring it to the
same finish as the rest of the surface, using care not to
rub through the old finish at the edge of the patch. As it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
is the corners which are most liable to be rubbed through,
this process will not generally be difficult of application;
all that is necessary to secure a successful patch is to use
care at each step, and not to hurry the drying of the
different patches.</p>

<p><b>72. Wax finishing</b> is a good method of finishing any
kind of hard or dark-colored wood; (<b>A.</b>) it does not give
as satisfactory results, however, as do some other methods
of finishing, upon soft or light-colored wood. There are
a number of different kinds of wax finishes which can be
purchased in almost any desired quantity, (<b>B.</b>) but an
economical and satisfactory wax finish may be made by
dissolving as much pulverized resin as may be picked up on
a cent in a half pint of turpentine or gasolene heated in
a water or steam double vessel. After this is clear, cut
up and add a piece of beeswax as large as a thimble, and
allow the finish to simmer slowly, until it is clear, when it
is ready for use. This may be mixed in larger quantities
by using the same proportions. If placed in an air-tight
vessel, it will keep indefinitely.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) This finish should be applied hot, with a brush, as
smoothly and as evenly as possible, and allowed to stand
until it has become quite hard, when it should be polished
with a soft rag which is free from lint. As many coats as
desired may be applied, each coat being treated in the
same way, and adding to the beauty of the finish. Another
method of applying this finish, and which gives satisfactory
results upon broad surfaces, is to make a pad of a rag,
and rub the wax on the wood, rubbing until it is dry.
This is not as satisfactory as it is to use a brush upon
work where there are many corners to finish around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>One of the advantages of this wax finish is that it may
be brightened if it becomes dim by going over it with a
soft cloth, or it may be renewed and improved by another
coat at slight expense and little trouble.</p>

<p>This is also a satisfactory method of finishing a dark floor
made of a wood which will not splinter when it is rubbed.</p>

<p><b>73.</b> (<b>A.</b>) <b>Oil finish</b> is perhaps the most simple way to
finish a piece of furniture; it is best adapted to hard,
dark woods. The material is made by mixing a quarter
of a pint of turpentine with seven eighths of a quart of
boiled linseed oil. It should be spread evenly over the
surface to be finished, and should stand until as much of it
as will, has soaked into the wood, when the surface should
be brought to a finish by rubbing. This will require muscle,
as the finish should stand about ten hours, during which
time a thin film or skin will form, which must be removed
by rubbing. Only a soft rag, free from lint, should be
used, and be sure that the folds of the cloth do not leave
their marks upon the surface. Rub with the grain.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Oil finish is a very durable finish, easily taken
care of, and is used to some extent in finishing the most
artistic furniture, being especially adapted to finishing
mahogany. It has a character peculiarly its own, and
exposure to moisture and heat affects it less than almost
any other form of finish. As it should be occasionally
oiled, it improves with age and care. This finish was used
in olden times, and the care of generations gives a polish
attainable by no other method.</p>

<p><b>74. Varnish</b> forms the finish which is used most commonly
upon all grades and kinds of work. (<b>A.</b>) The
different grades are made of various vegetable gums and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
resins, cut in turpentine and mixed with boiled oil. A
cheap grade of varnish or hard oil may be made by boiling
resin, turpentine, and boiled oil together. Other gums
may be treated the same way; the varnish used upon the
best work, for instance, is made from copal, a vegetable
product of the tropics. By a very careful process of boiling,
straining, and ripening, extending over months,
copal is made into the product which is used so extensively
upon furniture finishing, carriages, etc.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) Varnish should be applied in a room heated to
about 80° F., the dust should be laid by sprinkling, and
there should be no drafts of air, nor flies or other insects
to light upon it, if the best results are desired.</p>

<p>(<b>C.</b>) In flowing varnish, instead of laying a thin coat
as in shellac, a thick coat should be applied. This may be
done by using a thick, heavy brush; some prefer a heavy,
round brush, and others think they can obtain the best
results from a broad, flat brush. The finer the hairs, the
better the results obtained.</p>

<p>The brush must be taken up full of varnish, enough to
cover the entire surface, if possible, and spread or flowed
very quickly. The brush should then be wiped out in
the varnish pot. With the brush thus dried, go over the
surface, picking up all that the brush will absorb; wipe
this out in the pot, and repeat the operation until nothing
is left but a thin film of varnish. If this is done properly,
it will prevent all runs and streaks which result from unskillful
workmanship.</p>

<p>When this coat is thoroughly dried, rub with number 00
sandpaper, pulverized pumice stone, or a smooth block of
pumice stone (carriage painter’s method), and repeat the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
process until the desired body of varnish is obtained. Rub
down last coat with oil and polish. Allow as much time
between last coats as possible, as the harder the varnish
is, the better and more durable the work will be when
completed.</p>

<p><b>75. Polishing.</b>—This term applies to the process by
which a polish is built up by rubbing, or “ragging” as
workmen sometimes call it. The piece to be polished
should receive two or three coats of shellac or varnish,
which should be rubbed down to a surface, when it is
ready for the polish.</p>

<p>To make a pad of convenient size for polishing, fold a
piece of old, soft cloth, free from lint, and fill it with cotton
waste; or the end of a roll of cloth may be covered
by the piece which is to do the actual polishing. Provide
a cup of moderately thin shellac and another of boiled oil,
of which about one quarter is turpentine; or better, a cup
of sweet oil without turpentine. Dip the pad into the
oil and allow it to soak in completely, then do the same
with the shellac. Now dip the pad again into the shellac,
and with the finger put on a single drop of oil, and rub
lightly upon the work, with a circular motion, or if the
work is large enough, the stroke may be longer. If the
work is done with a straight stroke, do not stop at the end
of the stroke, as the instant between the end of one stroke
and the beginning of the return may be enough to allow the
shellac to stick and make a hole in the surface, which will
be difficult to repair; begin and end the stroke with a sweeping
motion. The idea of this method of polishing is to bring
the shellac to a polish, using as little oil as possible for lubricating,
as the less oil used, the better will be the polish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p><b>76. Brushes.</b>—(<b>A.</b>) If brushes are to be used for stain
or for filling, a cheap brush of any suitable size will do,
a flat brush being preferred upon ordinary work. For
shellac and varnish, the finer the brush, the better the
results usually obtained. Ordinarily it is the best practice
to use as large a brush as the nature of the work will permit,
as it will hold more, and cover more surface, than a
smaller brush, and have fewer “laps.” Chisel-pointed,
flat brushes, from 1½” to 2½” in width, will be found satisfactory
for the work of schools and amateurs, but upon
professional work, brushes from 3½” to 5” often are used.</p>

<p>(<b>B.</b>) The care of the brushes is an important part of
the work of those who use them, as neglect or carelessness
may destroy a valuable brush overnight. Unless a brush
is going to be used again the next day, it is always best to
clean it thoroughly. If a stain, filling, paint, or varnish
brush, use gasolene or turpentine, but if a shellac brush,
use wood alcohol, cleaning off all the small particles. To
obtain the best results, all brushes should be washed in
hot, soapy water, and afterward rinsed in clean water; in
general, however, this latter precaution may be dispensed
with, unless the brushes are to be laid away indefinitely.
Unless the above precautions have been taken, care should
be taken that shellac and varnish brushes are not changed
from one to the other. Never allow a brush to stand on its
side for more than a few minutes at a time, as a wrong direction
is easily given the bristles, and the brushes may be
quickly destroyed by a little carelessness or negligence.</p>

<p>Old brushes, well broken in and cared for, will give better
results than new brushes; therefore they should be treated
with every possible consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Varnish brushes often are left in the varnish pot, and if
they are hung up so that they will not rest upon their
bristles, this is the best way to keep them when they are
in almost constant daily use.</p>

<p class="c xxlarge">VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</p>


<p class="c">By JOHN M. GILLETTE, Professor of Sociology in the<br />
State University of North Dakota</p>

<p class="c">$1.00</p></div>

<div class="bbox">

<p class="ad">In this volume is presented for teachers, superintendents,
and teachers’ reading circles an illuminating discussion of
the present general movement for vocational education.
By this phrase is meant not only industrial education; but all
the training courses needed to meet the practical demands of
life.</p>

<p class="ad1">¶ The author explains at some length the principles, demands,
and methods of vocational education; he states the
grounds upon which hopes of success may reasonably rest;
he indicates some actual results gained by schools conducted
on more practical lines; and he points out others which
would follow upon the reorganization of our educational system
in general.</p>

<p class="ad1">¶ The vocationalizing of the schools has regard to the constitution,
inclination and ability of the individual, and is intended
to give him suitable training for his niche in life, to
show him how he can make the most of himself and in what
line he can prove himself most productive to society. At
the same time, this scheme of education does not ignore the
informational, the cultural, and the disciplinary aspects—it
insists that the individual be fitted for good citizenship.</p>

<p class="ad2">¶ The introduction of vocational education into the public
school system of the United States, with the curriculum adapted
to the chief kinds of occupation belonging to each community,
will mean greater development and power for the
country. From vocational education, introduced to meet the
differing community needs, will result greater efficiency and
better appreciation of the schools, increased attendance of
pupils, greater compensation for teachers, greater productiveness,
higher wages, and improved society.</p></div>

<p class="c xxlarge sp">AN ELEMENTARY TEXT-<br />
BOOK OF THEORETICAL<br />
MECHANICS</p>


<p class="c ad">By GEORGE A. MERRILL, B.S., Principal of the
California School of Mechanical Arts, and Director of
the Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts, San Francisco</p>

<p class="c">$1.50</p>

</div>

<div class="bbox">

<p class="ad">MERRILL’S MECHANICS is intended for the upper
classes in secondary schools, and for the two lower
classes in college. Only a knowledge of elementary
algebra, plane geometry, and plane trigonometry is required
for a thorough comprehension of the work.</p>

<p class="ad1">¶ By presenting only the most important principles and
methods, the book overcomes many of the difficulties now
encountered by students in collegiate courses who take up
the study of analytic mechanics, without previously having
covered it in a more elementary form. It treats the subject
without the use of the calculus, and consequently does not
bewilder the beginner with much algebraic matter, which
obscures the chief principles.</p>

<p class="ad1">¶ The book is written from the standpoint of the student
in the manner that experience has proved to be the one
most easily grasped. Therefore, beyond a constant endeavor
to abide by the fundamental precepts of teaching, no one
method of presentation has been used to the exclusion of
others. The few necessary experiments are suggested and
outlined, but a more complete laboratory course can easily be
supplied by the instructor.</p>

<p class="ad2">¶ The explanation of each topic is followed by a few well-chosen
examples to fix and apply the principles involved. A
number of pages are devoted to the static treatment of force,
with emphasis on the idea of action and reaction. Four-place
tables of the natural trigonometric functions are included.</p>

DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY</p>


<p class="c ad">By ALBERT E. CHURCH, LL.D., late Professor of
Mathematics, United States Military Academy, and
GEORGE M. BARTLETT, M.A., Instructor in
Descriptive Geometry and Mechanism, University of
Michigan.</p>

<p class="c">$2.25</p>

<p class="c">Part I. Orthographic Projections. $1.75</p></div>

<div class="bbox">

<p class="ad">This is a modern treatment of descriptive geometry with
applications to spherical projections, shades and shadows,
perspective, and isometric projections, for the use of
technical schools and colleges. Though based upon Professor
Church’s Descriptive Geometry, and retaining as much as
possible the original lucidity and conciseness, this work differs
from it quite widely.</p>

<p class="ad2">Among the salient features of the book are the following:
The figures and text are included in the same volume, each
figure being placed beside the corresponding text; General
cases are preferred to special ones; A sufficient number of
problems are solved in the third angle to familiarize the student
with its use; A treatment of the profile plane of projection
is introduced; Many exercises for practice have been
introduced; Several new problems have been added; The old
figures have been redrawn, and many of them have been improved;
Several of the more difficult elementary problems
have been illustrated by pictorial views; In the treatment of
curved surfaces, all problems relating to single-curved surfaces
are taken up first, then those relating to warped surfaces, and
finally those relating to surfaces of revolution. Experience
proves this order to be a logical one, as the procedure is from
the simple to the more complex. Also the student is more
quickly prepared for work on intersections and developments.</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
